</script><tw-passagedata pid="1" name="Prologue" tags="" position="142,145" size="100,200">The sound of my footsteps, echoing down the long barren hallway, was suddenly the only thing I could hear. Gone were the sounds of screaming and heavy arguing, furniture being pushed over, a sound that I wish to bring back. The silence that had set in was haunting, chilling me to my very core. Every breath I take sends a light shiver through my chest, fading out with the pounding of my heart. I stop and try to compose myself, failing immensely. My parents, they were just having an argument. True, my young ears weren’t accustomed to such thing, but I knew they existed.

I take another step forward, and it feels as though the entire house suffers from the weight of my action. Something was very wrong, that not escaping my notice. I was young, yes. I had vivid dreams and a wild imagination that went alongside those dreams nicely, but even I could not merely imagine this. The air of the house was unlike anything I have ever felt.

[[Continue on.]]
[[Call for my parents from here.]]

&lt;&lt;audio &quot;prologue&quot; volume 0 fadeto 0.60&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
I need to see what was going on, with my own eyes. The only way to do that was to continue on. The closer I get to their door, the more I feel a peculiar feeling overtake me. It was as if something was pushing down on me, wishing to bring me to my knees.

[[Continue-&gt;The Scene]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Call for my parents from here." tags="" position="258,100" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;audio &quot;prologue&quot; loop volume 0 fadeto 0.60&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
Perhaps calling them now was the safest option, that way I didn’t have to take another step.

“Mom? Dad? Are you okay?” The minute the words leave my mouth, I regret them. It was a foolish question. Whether they were making up now or not, the past sounds were evidence enough that not everything was okay.

“Is that you dear? Come, we’re sorry that we woke you,” I hear my mother chuckle softly. Despite the soothing words, the tone in which they were said did little to relax my trembling body and racing heart. I think about her words, shrugging my shoulders as I continue towards the door. The closer I get to their door, the more I feel a peculiar feeling overtake me. It was as if something was pushing down on me, wishing to bring me to my knees.

[[Continue-&gt;The Scene]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Head back to my room." tags="" position="257,205" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;audio &quot;prologue&quot; volume 0 fadeto 0.60&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
I should turn back now. I nod to myself as if reaffirming what I was thinking. I turn on my heel and before I was able to take a full step, I feel a cold wind.

“Is that you dear? Come to me,” I hear my mother’s voice command. Despite the soothing words, the tone in which they were said did little to relax my trembling body and racing heart. I chew on the corner of my cheek, the feeling of something being off had only increased.

“I’m just gonna go back to bed.” I wait to hear what she would say in response to that. Upon hearing nothing, I continue towards my room.

“I said come,” a low growl demands and before I can question it, I feel myself turn, walking back the way I came. I command my feet to stop, I even attempt to fall, but they continue on with a mind of their own. I couldn’t feel them, they were no longer mine to control.

[[Continue-&gt;The Scene]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="The Scene" tags="" position="377,148" size="100,200">I gaze up at the large door, not remembering it to ever be this large in the past. I reach towards it with shaky hands, unsure of what will rest behind it. At this point, my entire body is shaking profusely, I feel as if I will pee myself at any moment. Before I can open it myself, the door slowly swings open on its own accord.

I stand in stunned silence. I can feel the onset of an ache as my body remains motionless, fighting only the trembling of my legs. My father’s mutilated body is strewn in every corner of the room. His blood coating both the walls and floors. Some of his limbs and organs are arranged to the side in a perverse abstract sort of way. The only noise originates from my injured mother, a few feet away from me and begging with every fiber left in her body.

She opens her mouth when her eyes go wide, a red hue overtaking them, abolishing all color. Her head falls to the side, signaling her death, her mouth remaining open as whatever her last words - whatever they were going to be - remain on the tip of her tongue.

I still can’t move, but my body allows itself to shake. A dark shadow rests over my mother’s motionless figure. What I suppose is a leg, is still inserted into her chest. The shadow glares at me, a lopsided cartoonish grin on its face. It was the only sign of a facial expression, as the only other thing on its face were two white dots that symbolize its eyes.

[[Attack it.]]
[[Question it.]]
[[Control myself.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Attack it." tags="" position="493,77" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;set $pacifist -= 10&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;set $darkburns = true&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;set $injuries = &quot;third degree burns on arms&quot;&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
Fury, wrath, vengeance. Everything and anything that encompasses the full might of anger becomes my primary focus. I lunge at the creature, but it doesn’t move. I see why when my arms pass through it. I prepare for the rest of my body to follow suit when I’m suddenly frozen, parts of my hands disappeared in whatever mass this creature exudes.

At first, I feel no pain. It is as if I had stuck my hands in a hole and I couldn’t yank them back out. But that was at first. I glance up at the creature’s face, that grin still plastered on it. That is when I feel a burning sensation, the feeling of my hands being scorched overcoming me. I yank with all of my strength, but besides having my legs give out underneath me, I get nowhere. I scream and whimper, thrusting around, balling my hands into fists but nothing works.

I look back up at the creature. Its mouth is gone, and its glowing white eyes have turned a pale red. It leans down, so it’s closer to my face.

“Now what did you think you’d gain from doing that?” it questions, cocking its head to the side in an unnatural way. It says such words as if the thought of the action honestly hurt it. Words form in the back of my throat but never move past that point. Whether it was the shock of watching my parents die, or because of the pain of my hands feeling as if I stuck them in a boiling pot of water, I am unable to utter a single sound.

“Friends don’t attack each other,” it coos into my ear, its breath stinging my neck. Its words help me find my own. With tears leaving their trails down my face, I glare at it.

“You killed my parents. You’re a monster. Not my friend!” It comes even closer, its face directly in front of mine as it searches my eyes.

“You invited the monster.” It continues to stare at me, my heart aching at everything that I had experienced in the last thirty minutes.

“Why? Why would you do this?” It cocks its head to the side in an unnatural angle.

“Why do any of us do anything? Because we are merely puppets to our masters.”

“What does that even mean!” I scream in anger and confusion.

“I wouldn’t expect a child to understand, but one day you will. And I’ll be there to help guide you every step of the way, my friend.”

I take multiple deep breaths, attempting to calm both my mind and body. I open my eyes and the trembles return, everything I had just done was for not. It continues to gaze at me, trying to figure out what I was doing. It comes over to me and places a delicate finger on my heart.

“It&#39;s. Still. Thumping.” With every word it taps my heart harshly, sending a tremor through my body. When it finally removes its finger, I press my hand to my heart. Whatever it did - it left a burning mark.

[[Continue-&gt;Running Away]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="&quot;No, you won&#39;t!&quot;" tags="" position="615,369" size="100,100">“No, you won’t. I created you and I can make you disappear.” It lets out a hearty laugh and turns to me fully, leaving my mother’s body behind. It takes a threatening step towards me and I clench my eyes closed, commanding it to go away. I open them, but it is still stalking towards me.

“Go away,” I shout, repeating what I had done before. It grows closer.

“I said go –” Before I can scream the sentence, it appears in front of me, its height and presence engulfing me. It grabs my jaw, one of its claws digging deep into my cheek as it tightens its grip.

“Go away? Go away! You think you can command me! You stupid child. I am not your mere imagination, here for your pleasure.” Tears sprinkle my eyes as everything that has happened catches up to me. Confusion racks my body, and I fall to my knees, sobbing.

[[Continue-&gt;Running Away]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="&quot;I still don&#39;t understand.&quot;" tags="" position="616,258" size="100,100">“And you won’t, for a long time.” It lets out a bored sigh and turns to me entirely, leaving my mother’s limp form behind. It takes a step towards me, and I take one back, not knowing its intentions.

“Tell me something. What am I supposed to do?”

“Nothing that you haven’t been doing. Your parents were just in the way you see, they needed them gone.” It grows closer.

“Who are they?” Instead of answering, it appears in front of me, its height and presence engulfing me. It grabs my jaw, one of its claws digging deep into my cheek as it tightens its grip.

“So many questions. Wouldn’t you rather take this time to grieve?” Tears sprinkle my eyes as everything that has happened catches up to me. Confusion racks my body, and I fall to my knees, sobbing.

[[Continue-&gt;Running Away]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="Running Away" tags="" position="731,133" size="100,200">“But why?” I question, my gaze dashing from one corner to another as more ghostly shadow figures join the lone one. I shiver tremendously, feeling the presence of a dark figure coming up on my back. I suppress the whimper forming in the back of my throat and clench my eyes closed, opening them a moment later. My eyes widen, shocked to see the room completely empty of the dark figures, and the shadow that I once thought was a friend.

Before I can further react to this, questioning their whereabouts and intentions, something grabs my ankle. I scream, jumping out of my skin to see my mother’s glazed over eyes locked on mine.

“Run.” She barely finishes the word before a series of loud pitched screams erupt from behind me.

[[Do as she says, run.]]
[[Glance behind me.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="Do as she says, run." tags="" position="859,275" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
I didn’t need to be told twice. The adrenaline kicks in and I race out of the room, refusing to look back. The mix of roars, shrieks, and moans tell me that my decision was wisely made, and I continue on.

[[Continue-&gt;Running Away2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="Glance behind me." tags="" position="866,82" size="100,100">I’m frozen in my spot due to my curiosity and want to know what was going on. My inquisitiveness overrides my mother’s dying words and my own primordial instincts. I look over my shoulder and see dozens of skeletal bodies attempting to break through the wall as if it was elastic. Different limbs try to break the barrier at all times, but the wall moves with them, never allowing them freedom. And then suddenly, the wall goes back to its normal state, but the figures surge forward, each reaching for me with gaping mouths.

[[Continue-&gt;Running Away2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="Running Away2" tags="" position="1002,135" size="100,200">I fly down the hall, attempting to navigate my darker than usual home. I once felt nothing but complete solace behind these walls. I can easily remember coming home from stressful childhood school days, smelling the aroma of meatballs as I paraded through the door, being free for another day. I zoom past a window just in time to see the small playground set that I helped my father build. The joy I had once experienced once we had finished it evades me now, blocked by my need to escape to safety.

“Where will you run?” I hear the lead shadow figure scream in rage, the figures shooting out of the walls, their mouths dripping with blood. They smell of rotten eggs and spoiled garbage, their smell polluting the house.

I attempt to push past it, but the smell brings water to my eyes. Shock begins to set in, and I feel my energy wane greatly.

“There’s the door,” I hear it mock, and some unseen force begins to swing the door back and forth.

[[Go for the door.]]
[[Go for a window.]]
[[Go for my room.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="20" name="Go for the door." tags="" position="1123,178" size="100,100">I pick up my pace, it was right, the door was right there. I can make it, that’s all I have to do. I just have to make it. I feel like I’m about to trip, trying my hardest to make it there. Suddenly my mother appears before me, her arms open wide as I run straight into her embrace. The smell is gone, the feeling of complete desperation and horror is lifted.
		
I hear birds outside, and I glance around to see that it’s an average day.

“Shh, bad dream?” she questions. She draws back and cocks her head slightly to the side, wiping away the tears that fall down my cheek.
		
“It was awful,” I scream at her, and she rubs my back in soothing circles, rocking me back like she always does. Her embrace is warm, and I feel myself melt into it, wishing for her to never let me go.

“It’s okay, it’s over now. No more bad dreams, no more bad dreams,” she continues to say this gently. Not before long she stops, a cold, stale wind setting in and her soothing rubs turn to aching scratches. I know what has happened, I know my fault and the trick that was played on me.

“There’s the door,” I hear her growl in my ear, my hair raising.

I feel myself sinking, being dragged down by a hundred different slimy hands all at once. They cling to the fabric of my clothing, tugging and stetching the material. They call for me, telling me that this was always meant to be, this is my fate. Darkness begins to impede my vision of the door, still swinging as if to mock me.

[[Season One]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="21" name="Go for a window." tags="" position="1124,61" size="100,100">I suddenly turn direction, heading for the closest window which happened to be nearby. The door is a trick, nothing but more torture awaits me there. I pick up my pace. I can make it, that’s all I have to do. I just have to make it. I feel like I’m about to trip, trying my hardest to just make it – and I do.

My hands fidget with the window locks, clumsily trying to unlock them as the pressure surrounding me escalates.

“Are you fast enough?” I hear a mocking voice ask, and against my better judgment turn to see all and any form of light fade from the hallway, the darkness encroaching. I turn back and with a steady breath unlock the rest of the locks. I push the window up as far as I can, clawing at the window screen. The voice repeats its words, getting closer and closer to me. But I can make it.

I tear a big enough hole in the screen for me and begin to hoist myself out, right as a figure shoots up. A non-discernible shape overwhelms  me, its hands clasping around my neck.

“You’re not real,” I try to persuade myself, and as if hurt by my words, the figure’s grip tightens. It crawls through the small hole in the screen, one lean leg after another, and then its body follows. It does this all while keeping me firmly in its grasp, its actions causing the shock to build up, threatening to cause me to faint. It stands at full height, its eyes boreing into mine. It cocks its head a full ninety degrees and continues to stare.

“Not real!” it suddenly blurts, its mouth opening in ways that no normal jaw would allow. “Do you hear this. We’re not real!” Its head bounces from one side to the other as if trying to laugh but not knowing how. Its actions come to a grinding halt, and it leans its face mere inches away from mine.

“You’re lucky I can’t kill you.” Before I can question what it means, I feel myself sinking, being dragged down by a hundred different slimy hands all at once. They cling to the fabric of my clothing, tugging and stetching the material. They call for me, telling me that this was always meant to be, this is my fate. Darkness begins to impede my vision of the window, parts of the screen flapping frivolously in the wind, bidding me goodbye.

[[Season One]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="22" name="Go for my room." tags="" position="1123,292" size="100,100">I suddenly turn direction, heading for my room instead. The door was a trick, nothing but more torture waited for me there. I pick up my pace. I can make it, that’s all I have to do. I just have to make it. I feel like I’m about to trip, trying my hardest to just make it. Maybe this was all a dream, brought on by my shadow friend. My room could make this all go away, hiding underneath my covers and counting to ten like my father told me too.
		
The hallway seems to extend, getting longer and longer, the door to my room always drifting just out of reach. Perhaps I’ll never make it, a thought that repeats on loop, until my hands clasp around the cold knob. In one fluid motion, I throw my door open, close it behind me, and lock it. I practically jump onto my bed and under the covers, hugging myself as I begin to count. I reach for my teddy, a constant reminder of my youth and the fear that something is always lurking within the confines of my room. The noises from outside grow louder, their fetid odor invading my room. No matter, I continue to count, my voice trembling and my head aching.

“Nine. Ten.” Everything is silent. The smell is gone, and I no longer hear the moans of the damned outside my door, clawing to get in. My body continues to shake uncontrollably, even though my brain tries to signal everything to calm down.

I remove the blanket, jumping at the black figure and the crystal white eyes that glare back at me once I do.

“You’re mine,” it exclaims and surges towards me, hands gripping my shoulders. I feel myself sinking, being dragged down by a hundred different slimy hands all at once. They cling to the fabric of my clothing, tugging and stetching the material. They call for me, telling me that this was always meant to be, this is my fate. I clench my eyes closed in terror, counting, again and again, to clear it all away. Desperately searching for my teddy bear, knowing that the stuffed animal will forever be kept out of my reach.

“And then what happens?” I finally raise my gaze to look at the woman sitting stoically in front of me. I had to commend her for the brave face she was wearing, it was almost believable. Yet, I have seen far too many therapists to know that she was just as freaked out as everyone else I’ve been ‘suggested’ to see.

“Nothing ... I woke up after that.” I gaze down at my fingers again, twiddling my thumbs as the images of the dream leave my mind.

“And this specific dream? Do you have it often? Exactly the same way?”

“No, more comes back to me each time I have it like it’s not just a dream.”

“Well that’s the thing, it is just a dream. Your brain is just adding more to it each time.”

“But I thought dreaming wasn&#39;t lucid?”

“It can be lucid, but most of the time it isn&#39;t. We dream of something random with minor importance and don&#39;t even remember it when we awake. But we can also train our brains to dream of certain things, and they can get pretty vivid sometimes. It seems like whether you like it or not, your brain is trained to keep adding to this horrific story. When was the last time you had this dream? Not counting the most recent of course.”

I shake my head, trying to recall the last time I suffered from this dream, “um, four or five years ago I think.”

“Right when you started college,” she points out and nods her head while writing something down, “perhaps this dream is brought on by stress?”
&lt;&lt;if $darkburns&gt;&gt;\
	
	“Then why does the dream explain how I got this?” I question and hold up both of my hands to show her the now healed markings. The skin of my hands and forearms was severely lighter than my true tone, and from a distance, one would just think that I was wearing long gloves.
	
	“Your records show that you were severely burned in a house fire, the same one that killed your parents. Perhaps this is your brain’s way of coping with this information.” I let out an exasperated sigh, shaking my head and leaning back in my seat. But she was right. I remember the fire, the feeling of passing out as the flames licked my skin, the smell of acrid smoke.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $darktruth&gt;&gt;\
	
	“Then why does the dream explain how I got this?” I question and point to the scar that rests on my jaw. Even though it has healed, it was still a deep enough scar that it remained a haunting dark red shade. At times, I would forget that the scar still rested there, and I paid for it when I accidentally scratched and found a deep gully on the side of my face.
	
	“Your records show that you had an accident, you slipped and fell on exposed metal. It says that the cut was gravely infected and almost killed you. Perhaps this is your brain’s way of coping with this information.” I let out an exasperated sigh, shaking my head and leaning back in my seat. But she was right. I remember the event, the feeling of the metal slicing through my skin as I clutched my jaw in horror.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $darkcontrol&gt;&gt;\
	
	“Then why does the dream explain how I got this?” I question and point to my heart, knowing that she had seen pictures of the wound. Residing in different areas of my heart were three circle wounds, resembling those of bullet holes. It looked as if something had tried to mine its way to my heart but failed and only caused cracks to occur.
	
	“Your records show that you were caught up in an unfortunate drive-by from a local gang, it says you were shot three times, your parents were killed. Perhaps this is your brain’s way of coping with this information.” I let out an exasperated sigh, shaking my head and leaning back in my seat. But she was right. I remember the event, the sounds of gunshots ringing in my ear, the panicked screams from everyone nearby. And that quiet yet oh so clear sound of my heart slowing, the beats fading with every loud thrum.

	I walk an unfamiliar path through even more unfamiliar woods. The sky is blocked out by towering skeleton trees. Though they hide no secrets, I feel as if invisible eyes watch me from their gangly branches. They guide me forward, moaning horribly whenever I wander from the path.
	
	This is a dream, that much I knew. Yet how to wake myself eludes me. I continue on.
	
	I turn a corner and see a figure covered in branch-like limbs. They twitch, and the sound they make makes it seem like they are breaking under unseen weight.
	
	[[Call out to the figure.]]
	[[Throw something towards it.]]
	[[Approach it.]]
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	Six crows stare down at me from their barren perches. 
	
	Life resides all around us, but the tree that they chose was dead and has been that way for some time. Desolate branches cling to the tree’s trunk, some lay limp on its side, the last fibers connecting it. It was a peculiar sight. A forest filled with life, birds chirping and frogs croaking in the distance. But here, here sat six crows whose glares were fixed on me.
	
	I walk from one place to another, seeing if they were just frozen or if they were actually looking at me. My thoughts answered when their gazes follow my actions. I turn around, half expecting to see a scene like last time. I knew this was a dream. This dream state screamed the truth at me but how to wake up eludes me. No one is behind me. No one else exists, just me and the six crows.

//Two Years Ago,//

	I reside on the edge of my bed, flipping through pages of my textbook as I try to figure out what’s important, and what isn’t. It would be my luck to have gotten a professor whose distaste for technology rivals that of her disfavor for millennials.

	“You kids are slaves to the devices in your hand,” I mimic her most treasured line in class as I search for the answer to the discussion post.

	“Knock knock,” I hear Chris’s voice, and give him permission to enter. I raise a brow at his sprightly attitude and wonder if he finally got the courage to ask that one girl out.

	“Guess what, $name!” Part of me didn’t wish to entertain him, he would tell me either way so what did it matter?
	
	[[“What?”]]
	[[Silently stare.]]
	[[Guess.]]
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
//One Year Ago,//

	&quot;What the hell is the matter with you?&quot; I hear a commanding voice ask. His voice carries well into my room, each word reverberating off the walls. If there is a response, I can&#39;t hear it.
	
	&quot;I paid for your ass to come here, and this is what you do? You don&#39;t even know what you&#39;re studying! I didn&#39;t send you here to waste my money on fraternity bullshit and bartending.&quot; Seeing that my desk was close to the door, it was unbelievably tempting to just open it up more, if only to hear the responses. And so I do just that.
	
	&quot;This is my life, I&#39;d be damned if I don&#39;t spend it the way I want,&quot; I hear Chris reply and following it is the all too familiar sound of flesh hitting flesh. 
	
	&quot;Watch your mouth,&quot; I hear his mother say. Silence sets in after that, but after a few seconds, I barely make out the voice of who I suspect to be Chris&#39;s father.
	
	&quot;Listen here, boy, you&#39;re way to smart too be spending your time doing stupid things. You&#39;re going to graduate and get a good job, enough of this childish shit. You hear me?&quot;
	
	&quot;Get out,&quot; I hear Chris growl.
	
	&quot;What did you just say to me?&quot;
	
	&quot;Get out! Before I call campus police,&quot; he shouts. His shout causes me to jump, unprepared for the ferocity behind it. I peer into the living area of our suite to see his father grumbling, stalking towards the door, and out.
	
	&quot;You know better than to talk to your father like that. What has gotten into you?&quot; his mother asks next, following the same path as her husband. She sees me eavesdropping and gives me a sorrowful look, quickly scurrying out.
	
	Chris is the next to appear in my view, locking the door before resting his head on its cool surface.
	
	[[&quot;That sounded like it went well.&quot;]]
	[[&quot;Your dad sounds fun.&quot;]]

This decision was a matter of life or death. A decision that could tear apart countries, break up families, start a never-ending war. 

What to eat? 

I was exaggerating the depth of my choice, but that didn’t mean it wasn’t important.

“Will you just order something?” Sydero growls, her gaze moving from me to the patiently waiting waitress. If we didn’t have a crowd, I would give Sydero a piece of my mind. Mainly due to me being hungry, but the other half was because I had forewarned her of my indecisiveness. I was still looking over all of the possibilities, as well as the prices.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“What did you get, Chris?” I question, noticing that he was also giving me an undecipherable look, if I had to name it I would say it was annoyed empathy.
	
	“A salad.”
	
	“Why order something that won’t fill you up?” Sydero questions.
	
	“It does fill you up, and it’s healthy. Healthier than your double-decker bacon burger.”
	
	“Just hearing it said aloud makes me hungry,” she smirks, “what? Are you trying to watch your figure?”
	
	“I am, actually.”
	
	&quot;Whoa,&quot; I start, raising my hand to pause their conversation, &quot;when did this whole &#39;watching my figure&#39; thing happen? You live for junk food.&quot;

	&quot;It started when I started getting kidnapped by werewolves and having to rethink my entire life,&quot; he said pointedly, and I let him have it as Sydero raised another question that morphed into another argument.
	
	“Alright, thank you both.” I close the menu, finally knowing what I want. That, and the waitress was still standing there while these two fought. The last time they argued, I had to explain to the gas station clerk what they meant by faeries and human sacrifices.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“You make it seem like this decision isn’t important,” I tell Sydero who seems ready to pound her head on the table.

	“What did you order?”
	
	“If I tell you, will it make you order faster?” I shrug, and she groans heavily. I look back at my menu, considering it before finally knowing what I want. I close it and glance at Sydero who visibly perks up, along with the waitress.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“So, you know what you want?” the waitress asks, shaking out what I can only assume is a cramped hand.

The stench of death lingers in the air, a smell that drew both pleasant and unpleasant memories from Raum. He’s been on battlefields where death clung to the astral veil, ripping at it and demanding to set the land asunder. This was nothing, an unfortunate sideshow part of an otherwise much larger act.

They had arrived at the shed not too long ago, his men immediately going to work trying to find evidence. Him hoping that his personal werewolf could pick something up, anything. But each passing minute told him that what he searched for was long gone. It had left its handiwork behind before fleeing.

“We lost the trail boss,” Petri states, the only words Raum didn’t wish to hear at the moment.

“Nothing but dead bodies and some organs everywhere,” Langston adds in next. Perhaps that was why the smell had remained for so long. Raum straightened himself, not seeing the point in staying any longer.

“But,” Petri starts, motioning for him to follow, “there is one thing you might find interesting.”

Petri leads the group into the shed, much to Raum’s dismay. He’s seen worse, smelt worse, and done worse with his own hands. But that didn’t mean he was in the mood to dwell on such things. The sharp smell of pine abandons him, replaced by a sweet fetid smell. The smell of death was always the worst part of the job to him, the worst part of anything really. It reminds him of a million different rotten and foul smells, all conjoining at once to exist in the same place. He could deal with the sight, the feeling, the act ... but never the smell. It was why he left a scene quickly, leave the mess for another.

Petri stops at a dead werewolf body, moving the sheet that they had rested over him down. The sheet was Langston’s idea, Petri’s was to throw the bodies on the nearest pyre. He felt no sympathy or connection to those that laid dead around him. He was a lone wolf, had seen to that personally when pack life didn’t match his own ambitions. Raum offered him something no pack could, invulnerability. Throw that in with an uncaring attitude for when he hunted a human, and Petri’s loyalty was laid at his feet.

The doors of the abandoned house were thrown open, the knob thudding up against the wall, causing the noise to echo through the entire house.

It was another safehouse of Syd’s though I still had trouble believing it. The house in question is nestled in a large clearing in the woods. The white vertical boards making up the exterior part of the house weren’t completely clean, but I could tell that they were white. Some had minimum damage, and others looked as if they were still being maintained. The house sat upon a multicolored stone foundation, and the porch held railings that went around the majority of the house.

I had expected the inside to look worse but was pleasantly surprised. It wasn’t the most attractive home, but it was nothing like Sydero’s other safehouses. A few dirty furniture pieces decorate the rooms, and the walls showed no sign of wear. The same thing couldn’t be said about the floor, and though I wouldn’t walk around with my bare feet, I would sit on the ground without fear.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“This doesn’t look half bad,” Chris points out, trailing his hand down the wall, showing me his clean palm.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“This doesn’t look half bad,” I point out, trailing my hand down the wall and seeing a clean palm.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“This is my main safehouse, that’s the only reason it doesn’t look like shit,” Sydero grumbles, heading towards a tipped over lamp and righting it. “Thoughts on the electricity, Bradley?” I look for the kid but am unable to find him, until I see him to the side, busy on his computer.

“I can try to check the meter boxes, if not then I can try and see what I can do based off of what’s in the area. If I can&#39;t pull electricity in from somewhere else we might be out lof luck. Might take me a while too,  and I’ll have to get to it after I finish my current project.”

I raise a brow, “what’s your current project?”

“I’m trying to see if I can make your college debt disappear,” he smirks, fluttering his fingers in the air as he says it.
&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	
	“Bradley, have I ever told you how much I love you?” Chris questions, wiping away an imaginary tear.
	
	“No, and don’t start, please.”

Could it be possible that her words held truth? These dreams were rare yet horribly ironic, every time I begin to forget about them, the dream extended itself as if to remind me of its validity.

I begin to fumble with my keys. She could be onto something, this could just be my mind’s way of dealing with all the trauma I’ve faced. Anything else made little sense, especially seeing what my dreams consisted of. The only element that was in my dreams that I know is real is the shadow entity. But wasn’t that always my imagination? Was I falling back on the image of it to further visualize my inner pain?

I finally unlock the car I was slowly approaching. If the world was working against me, then this gift was one of the only things that hadn’t.

He turned to drinking but it didn’t last long, my father was there to help him – we were there to help him.

He was the first to envelop me in a hug after what happened. We were there for him when he lost his family members, and now he was there for me. He took me in, and though the next few years were hard, he helped me through.

They were dark days, and at first, I forgot that like me, he had lost someone important as well. I was selfish with my pain and rightfully so. My parents were ripped from my grasp at such a young age and in such an unfair way. But he lost his brother, a brother he grew up with and knew all of his life. A brother he watched graduate, get married, and have a kid. And though I was selfish, depriving him of his grieving at times, he never held it against me. He helped me the entire way, and I knew that if anyone knew where I was, it was him.

The less the dreams would come, and I would be safe behind a barrier of stressful foolhardiness.

Despite my best intentions, the stressful load got the better of me and stopped nothing. The pain kept coming, the dreams still bothered me, and my teachers did not let up. But regardless, I learned skills and formed new hobbies.

For all I know the driver was a guest, quickly finding a spot since they were going to be in and out. Though I guess that didn’t make me feel much better either, seeing that these spots were employee only. I decide to check the car, hoping I can recognize it.

It was a pretty blue Ford Fusion with an unrecognizable license plate from another state, no blemishes whatsoever. The inside was tidy with nothing but a pair of large fluffy white dice hanging from the rearview mirror to help me discern whose car it was. I finish my inspection, concluding that I’ve never seen the car. But I knew someone who probably would have.

&lt;&lt;set $daring +=5&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
I get out of my car with a determined look in my eye. I stalk towards the vehicle, inconspicuously trailing my key along the side harshly as I continue to walk forward. I stop before getting to the passenger’s side door, whistling to myself and pocketing my keys with a devilish grin. The asshole shouldn’t have taken my spot, I don’t care who they are.

&lt;&lt;set $ChrisRichardson = true&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
I head inside and go to clock in, listening to the daily dose of drama that my co-workers always had to share. Most of it was about crazy ex’s, pregnancy, upcoming parties, and finals. Everyone at The Alley was either a college student, college dropout, or simply had enough common sense not to go to college. They made for interesting conversation on the best of days, other times it was a minor distraction to take away from the crappy tips and rude customers.

The Alley was a small amusement park complete with a bowling alley, skating rink, mini-golf area, laser tag, bumper cars, bouncy house, and then arcade areas. There was a total of two restaurants here, not counting the room for private parties and birthdays. There were also two bar areas, one inside near the bowling section and another near the outdoor pool. It was a popular tourist attraction as well as a hotspot for the young and old in the town. And with summer fast approaching, our days would only get longer and harder.

[[It was a great job, not a career choice, but I loved it nevertheless.-&gt;NGD4_2]]
[[It was a decent job, good pay and company but that was about it.-&gt;NGD4_2]]
[[I hated the job but I needed it so what can I do.-&gt;NGD4_2]]

And sure enough, when I arrive, he’s there vaping with a few of our other co-workers. Unsuprisingly he&#39;s bopping his head to some imaginary beat, and when I get closer I hear him murmuring the lyrics, &quot;rock &#39;n&#39; roll ain&#39;t noise pollution. Rock &#39;n&#39; roll ain&#39;t gonna die.&quot; He finally sees me and immediately perks up, grinning like the Cheshire cat.

“Did you hear? We’re on outdoor bar duty. Those tips are about to be rolling in.”

&lt;&lt;if $optimistic &lt; 50&gt;&gt;\
	“That’s if we don’t get the lousy folks.”
	
	“Try to keep that pessimism at bay. Today we’re all about million-dollar smiles and perky attitudes.”
	
	“Sure. Any idea whose car that is in my spot?”
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $optimistic &gt;= 50&gt;&gt;\
	&quot;That&#39;s great news. If we&#39;re lucky, we&#39;ll get a few older folks and a whole lotta college aged tourists.&quot;
	
	&quot;Right, these are the moments I live for,&quot; he exclaims. I shake my head with a smile.
	
	&quot;By the way, do you know whose car that is in my spot?&quot;
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“Someone’s in your spot?” he asks, seeming as shocked as I. Like me, Chris had been working here for the past two years, and we had practically claimed our parking spots. If not through professional courtesy and unspoken understanding, then others knew not to park there because we were part of the influential senior crew.

“Yep, a blue Ford Fusion, know anyone who drives that?” He takes a long puff of his e-cig and closes his eyes, rocking back and forth slightly.

“I actually have no clue who has that car, did it look new?”

&lt;&lt;if $carcheck is true&gt;&gt;\
	“Yea, the inside looked like it was fresh off the lot.” 
	
	“Then it’s definitely not any of ours, I would’ve heard someone bragging about it by now. It could belong to that guy I’ve seen walking with Lorette.” Before I can ask him more about this mysterious man, I spot him for myself. My manager walks towards us with the man in tow, reminding me of some overly-protective chaperone.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	I shrug my shoulders just as our manager comes out, tapping on her tablet as she begins to bark out everyone’s job for the day. Beside her stands a man who doesn’t seem to understand personal space, gazing over her shoulder before peering at each of us.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“Everyone, this is our new General Manager, Mr. Pinsky. He wishes to supervise you all today to get a better understanding of how our days usually go.” Mr. Pinsky steps up, giving each one of us a card as he begins to explain his station, purpose, and the point of the cards. Suddenly I was thrust back to my freshman orientation class from two years ago.

“I&#39;ll be reviewing each of you and writing down my notes on these cards. Later, I&#39;ll give them to your manager, and speak to her about them. The Alley has huge potential, and I plan to expand on it.”

The perkiest among us immediately does what she is asked, while the rest of us stew in our spots about being supervised. The pressure of trying to act professionally was hard enough, and now we had no other choice but to grin and bear it. I gaze down at the card, it was asking the necessary things, nothing that wasn’t already on file.

The day starts and rolls on like any other day. The best part about working at the outdoor bar was the attractive company and the large tips, earned by a few flirtatious smiles and well-placed compliments.

Chris’s biggest tips came from the women, age and appearance mattered little. Chris adored working the outdoor bar because he was a master at gaining tips. Out here, our dress code was simpler and followed a tropical theme, allowing for Chris to wear clothes that complimented his physique. He didn’t shy away from muscle tank tops and loose swim trunks that gave away just enough to inspire the imagination. I watch with a small smirk as a woman takes a seductive sip of the drink Chris passes to her. She lets her eyes roam over his body before writing down her number and sliding it over to him along with a twenty-dollar tip.

“Excuse me.” I turn my attention to the patron that has approached my side of the bar.

“How can I help you?” I ask, placing a small smile on my face.

“Can I get a Strawberry-Lemon Mojito?” I nod and immediately begin to prep the overly ordered drink. I top it off with a beautiful flower ornament and slide it to her.
		
“This flower is beautiful, does it always come with the drink?” she asks, gently touching the flower as if scared it would fall apart under the pressure of her touch.

“No, I just didn’t think the drink was pretty enough to give to a girl of your beauty. Still isn’t, but I can only do so much.” I chuckle softly and send her another warm smile, one she returns immediately.

“Is that like some undercover compliment?”
		
“Was it? Sorry, you’re beautiful, was that one too forward?” She snickers and cocks her head to the side as if she was now seeing me differently.
		
“Kinda, but sometimes it’s nice to just be told without having to feel like I owe the person.” I feign shock.
		
“You mean people don’t line up to tell you this every day? The world is a tragic place.” Her smile expands, but she can say little else as her friends call her over. She sends me a broad smile and rummages through her bag for pen, paper, and a tip. With a wink, she slides the paper and tip my way before thanking me and walking off.

“A Rum and Tonic for me,” he states, placing both his ID and the initial cost of the beverage on the table. I grab the money and check the ID lazily before making him the drink. I give him a quick look over, trying to figure out how I was going to earn my extra tip. He appears like any of the other college frat guys that show up, even his swim trunks had the symbol of his fraternity. Thankfully, he made typecasting him easy, as soon as I gave him his drink he took a selfie.
		
I insert myself into the selfie, throwing up a peace sign. He doesn’t kick me out, but he does laugh, turning to face me with a raised brow.
		
“Do you want to make it look like you’re really having fun? Include me,” I joke, and he smiles, backing up more. I lean forward seductively, and he matches my vibe almost immediately, taking the picture before showing me.
		
“You’re really photogenic, or it could be that you’re naturally handsome,” I compliment.
		
“Thanks, I’m trying to be a model.” I nod my head, you and everyone else that comes in here with glistening six-pack abs.
		
“Nice, I can definitely see it.” He smiles again before handing me a ten and sending me a wink, leaving to join his friends.

My view is blocked by a few buildings, but I can still see the flashes as they continue to go off, each a few minutes apart. It resembles nothing like I’ve ever seen. I want to claim that it’s just fireworks, but the bold lighting of each explosion is nothing like a firework.

“What kind of firecrackers are those? And why would someone be setting them off?” I ponder aloud. Watching as another minor explosion goes off. This one didn’t share the same intensity as the others, in fact, it was as if it was a different grade entirely.

“Who knows?” Chris says from beside me, sipping on some of the water that he poured himself to combat the two drinks he had. Some of the others seem to agree with Chris and show little interest, continuing on as if the light had never happened. Perhaps it really was just fireworks. I look in the direction again, but when I see nothing, I shove it from my brain and continue my work.

&#39;&#39;Meanwhile, a couple streets away . . .&#39;&#39;

With a disgusted grimace, the woman gathers and spits out the wad of blood forming in her mouth. The metallic taste prolongs the sneer, and for a minute, she desperately craves the taste of water. But only for a minute. The act was for nothing as more blood gathers merely in its place, as well as the steady stream of blood arching down her cut cheek.

“For once in your life, Sydero, listen to me. Stop this, now,” a proud character with a blade orders, his voice wavering. Even when he was trying to sound like he was in command, it still came off as begging. The woman called Sydero rises to her feet and cocks her head, wiping a mix of sweat and blood from her brow.

“Done playing already?” she inquires. Before her opponent can reply, she lunges towards him, half of her body shrouded in a dark grey mist. He bites the inside of his lip, involuntarily drawing blood. He had no choice but to match her ferocity, lest he wanted to be killed. The two figures struck against one another for what seems like the tenth time, a weak bright light appearing before flickering and then finally disappearing. Both of their bodies were pushed back by the force, and they again find themselves on opposite sides of the street, glaring at one another.

“Is that your way of surrendering?” Sydero questions, flicking dirt out from underneath her fingernails. She looks over at him with an uninterested raised brow, knowing the expression and lack of care would anger the figure further.

“You selfish brat,” he growls, and Sydero’s back stiffens. She turns to face him fully, waiting for him to continue. “You know damn well why I can’t give you what you want, but still you search for it. If you love her, you’ll let her go, you know she’s safer with me.”

“Says who exactly?” she shouts back, “you? You’re on the opposite side of the river from me, but you’re still sinking in the same type of boat. You just refuse to patch the holes because you’re telling yourself they don’t exist.” He opens his mouth to respond, but she cuts him off with a warning growl.

“Here’s a promise. Either give her to me or die, damn the consequences.” The figure freezes as he glares at the woman in front of him, his eyes searching hers. If he failed to see the seriousness in her words, he only had to look into her color-shifting eyes. The amber color was slowly fading, dribbling down as if something was causing it to melt out of her iris. Replacing it was a bloody red whose brilliance was only rivaled by the slightly darker crimson color that edged in at the edges. The whites of her eyes disappeared along with her pupil, leaving nothing but the deadly shades of red.

Silence continues as anger courses freely through Sydero’s body. The figure trembles as he replays her words. This battle wasn’t the first, but no matter how many times they had met, she had never threatened him with death.

“Is this what it has come to?” he asks, shaking as a white mist begins to surround him, similar to the black mist surrounding her. “You threaten to kill me?”

Sydero doesn’t answer. She meant her words, and if forced to, would carry them out. But they also killed a part of her. She knew that going through with her threat would mean no return from the place she would go. Their eyes meet, hers a sea of blood and death, and his a pleading proud arctic blue.

“If you don’t surrender her, then so be it.” It was as if all the air in the area had been sucked out, giving room to an oppressive atmosphere, perfect for an explosion.

“Then so be it,” he whispers and the two surge towards one another in perfect accord. Their mists grow into crackles of raw energy, crimson and artic sparks shooting off of their body and ricocheting off of the streets and sidewalks. The figures meet.

I jump at both the sound of an explosion, and the feeling of it rocking the ground. Chris does the same, falling backward into one of the shelves, inconsequently causing some of the bottles to fall from their perch. But that is the least of my worries at the moment. The pool erupts into screams as everyone tries to figure out what is going on, scrambling to get away. I gaze in the direction of the previously perceived fireworks, seeing the cloud of smoke that rises from the area.

“The hell is going on? Did something blow up, like a pipe or something?” Chris asks no one in particular, especially seeing that both of us were the same amount of clueless.

“Did someone call the cops, the fire department?” I hear someone ask and a chorus of yes’s, sprinkled around the pool, answer him.

“We’re going to close up early,” my manager states, bounding towards us. We nod in agreement and begin the long and arduous job of rounding up a bunch of freaked out and upset customers, as well as cleaning everything up. We finish earlier than usual but are no less jumpy when we end.

Chris and I bounce ideas off of each other, trying to deduce what could have happened and guessing when the news would cover it.
&lt;&lt;if $keycar is true&gt;&gt;\
	
	“Who did this?” we both hear someone scream and see Mr. Pinsky standing beside what I perceive to be his car, pointing at the side. “Who keyed my car?” No one says anything, only a few trying to calm him down and tell him that it was probably some random teens.
	
	“I’m checking those cameras!” he shouts before getting into his car and driving off in a rush. Chris pushes me gently, raising an eyebrow, hoping I would confirm his suspicions.
	
	“I’m not admitting to anything,” I smirk, and he chuckles softly, nodding his head.

Thankfully I was given a key to the place, and I quickly run back into the back room to grab it.

I’m locking the door back up when I hear a strange sound coming from a nearby path on the other side of the building. I walk a few meters, gazing down the path that was there for no other reason but to help someone get to the pool faster. I hear the sound again, and I shift from one foot to the other uncomfortably.

“Hello? Are you okay? I’m here to help.” I receive another moan in response, this one a bit louder and movement follows. I approach the movement, and find myself standing near a trashcan, a young woman lies there hardly breathing.

&lt;&lt;if $medical &lt; 10&gt;&gt;\
	“Aw crap. Are you okay, miss?” I reach out and lightly touch her arm, hearing her grumble under my touch but otherwise receive no response. I notice her body shaking significantly, perhaps the result of her having a seizure.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“Aw crap. Are you okay, miss?” I reach out and lightly grab her arm, checking for a pulse. I&#39;m unable to find one but there could be a number of reasons for there not being one. I then place my phone under her nose, watching as a bit of condensation appears on the surface. She was still breathing normal so that was a good sign. I do a quick search of her body to make sure she&#39;s not bleeding, and to make sure nothing is broken. If she was, then moving her would be unwise.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“Hey, I’m going to help you, alright? I’m taking you to the hospital.” I bend down and attempt to pick her up, finding that she’s not the lightest person in the world. I’m able to help her to my car, freezing once I get there.

Honestly, I wasn’t a fan of having a complete stranger in the seat right beside me. I imagined her waking up and, out of panic, attacking me instantly. Something traumatic could have befallen her, or she could be a psycho, a psycho having a seizure and needing medical attention. It seems like the safest place to put her, and so I put her in the backseat, nodding to myself as I go back to the driver’s seat.

It was a suspicious thing to do, especially moving from the darkened path to my car with an unconscious woman in tow. But I wasn’t about to trust a passed-out stranger and the idea of having her anywhere in the car made me shake. I just didn’t want her sitting anywhere close to me. I would be careful not to go flying over any bumps and to park away from prying eyes, but I wasn’t putting her in the passengers seat or backseat.

	Once I arrive at the hospital, I enter with the woman, trying to make my struggle look as obvious as possible in hopes of getting a nurse to run to my aid. Finally, a familiar nurse sees me and rushes over.
	
	“$name? What happened?” Nurse Hillary asks, one of the nurses I knew fairly well thanks to my volunteer hours at the hospital. She was also one of the nurses I would be shadowing for my future internship.

	“I don’t know, I found her like this on a path near The Alley. No bruising, bleeding, or broken bones. I think she&#39;s in shock though.” Hillary hails another woman, this one I&#39;m not familiar with, and after relaying what I told her to the woman, rushes the woman away on a gurney.

	“Thank you $name, I need to get a quick statement from you before you go though.” This was to be expected, especially seeing that she could’ve been assaulted or raped. I nod in compliance, and Hillary begins to go through the motions. She allows me to go after asking all of the questions needed and I head home.

	“What happened?”

	“I don’t know, I found her like this on a path near the building where I work. I think she was having a seizure or something earlier.” The nurse hails another woman and after speaking in medical jargon, rushes the woman away on a gurney.

	“Thank you, but I do need to ask you some questions.” This was to be expected, especially seeing that she could’ve been assaulted or raped. I nod in compliance, and she begins to go through the motions. The nurse allows me to go after asking all of the questions needed and I head home.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

I check the time as soon as I get in the car, also shocked that my uncle hadn’t texted me since I had promised to come over and see him after work. I send him a quick text, promising to come by tomorrow.

Finally being able to drive home is a relief I never knew I needed. I take several deep breaths as I go, thinking back on everything that had occurred. My mind goes from my talk with my therapist, to the fireworks and explosion, and then to finding the woman unconscious on the path. 

I roll down the window and take multiple breaths. I just need to drive home. Tomorrow, I was back to the regular grind of my boring, insignificant life.

The next day, I sit in the library. Before me rests a series of books needed to complete my final essay for the semester. Involuntarily, my eyes gaze at the draft resting beside me, no longer recognizable due to the bright red markings and comments that adorn it. 

At first, I doubted this paper was even mine. But one look at the upper left-hand corner and I had my answer. Sitting nicely, void of that wretched red pen, in Times New Roman, 12-point font, double-spaced, was my name. That was probably the only thing that wasn’t crossed out or accompanied by that dreaded red slash. I couldn’t, and still can’t, grasp how I got such a bad grade on this paper.

This was the first paper that I had done on time, no procrastination.

&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
It wasn’t horrible procrastination; I didn’t do it the night before or anything. But for me to write an essay, I had to be in the mindset. It just so happened that I wasn’t in the mindset for this particular one until a day or two before it was due.

[[Continue-&gt;NGD7]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="88" name="NGD7" tags="" position="3409,637" size="100,100">I glance over at Chris who had decided to join me. He was more concerned with his phone than studying, a fact that wasn’t that shocking. If one chose to judge Chris based off of his appearance, they would conclude that he was your typical college frat boy. This being brought on by his brown wavy, bordering on unkempt at times, hair, light blue almost grey eyes, and a beard that transitioned between stubble and heavy throughout the year. Adding to that was him being a prominent member of the tennis team and having an unhealthy obsession with junk food and working out. 

But despite this, he was incredibly and annoyingly smart. He was the type of student that didn’t have to study to get good grades, and when he did study, well just hope that you were sitting beside him cos he cared little about others copying his test.

“Damnit!” Chris shouts, cringing when he remembers where he was, “I can’t win this level.” I gaze over at his screen, but the game doesn&#39;t look familiar.

“What are you studying anyway?” Chris asks, putting his phone down and turning to me entirely.

“Trying to get this final essay done.”

“Oh right, the one in Professor Perfection’s class. Did you ever check out the news and read up about that explosion?” I shake my head, forgetting all about that when I woke up.

“Cops and firefighters say an underground gas line blew up. No one was there, and besides some houses taking the brunt of it, everything was fine. That neighborhood is completely abandoned anyway, so the city doesn’t really care all that much.”

“Do they want to fix it?”

“Probably, but I’m sure they’re not going to be working their butts off to do it.” I nod my head and go back to studying, hearing Chris get impatient with the lack of attention probably. The thought causes me to smirk.

“Alright, I’m going to go to the coffee shop and get something real quick. Do you want your usual?”

[[“Tea? Yea.”-&gt;NGD7_1]]
[[“Definitely, bring me my coffee.”-&gt;NGD7_1]]
[[“Naw, just a bagel for me.”-&gt;NGD7_1]]

“And yet you still have the tendency to ask me stupid questions.”

“Blah blah blah,” he laughs, punching me lightly before walking off towards the nearby coffee shop.

	Chris comes back with what I requested, and I continue to do my research. My attention is taken off of it for a minute when my phone rings, the hospital&#39;s ID pops up.
	
	“Hello?” I answer.

	“Hello, $name?” Ms. Alanna asks, putting on her professional voice. It always tickles me, hearing how formal she was over the phone, yet how casual and carefree she was in person.

	“Hey Ms. Alanna, is everything okay?”

	“I’m calling about the young lady that you found and brought in last night.”

	“Is she okay?”

	“She’s fine, just some scattered bruising. She actually regained consciousness this morning. But that’s not the reason I called you. The police were unable to get anything from her, and we were hoping that she would talk to you since you were the one who found and helped her.”

“Yea sure, should I come by now?”

“Whenever you have time before five o’clock. Thank you.” And with that I hang up the phone. I was able to get one paragraph done and needed a break anyway, might as well go now since the campus was closer to the hospital than my job. I begin to pack up my stuff, Chris raising a brow.

	I arrive at the hospital sometime later, weaving my way in between patients and doctors and nurses, and really anyone else that happens to be walking around. I make a beeline for Alanna&#39;s desk. She types furiously at her keyboard, her eyes never leaving the screen, even when she stops to sip her coffee.
	
	&quot;Alanna,&quot; I chime, leaning dramatically on the desk.

	“$name, you made it. We can speak later if you want, but here&#39;s the the room number.” I thank her before departing and make my way to the appropriate room, spotting two nurses standing outside of it. One, I didn&#39;t know, but the other was Hillary.

	“Excuse me?”

	“Ah, $name, thanks for coming, she still hasn’t said a word to anyone since she’s been awake. We don’t know her name, age, or if she even has a family. We’re hoping, since you helped her out that she&#39;ll tell you.”

	I arrive at the hospital sometime later, weaving my way in between patients and doctors and nurses, and really anyone else that happens to be walking around. I make a beeline for the busy appearing receptionist.

	“Can I help you?” she asks, raising a brow but otherwise not giving me any other kind of attention.

	“Yes, I’m here for ...” I soon realize that I don’t even know the woman’s name or the name of the nurse that had called me. “I’m $name Roe. I received a call to come by to talk to a young woman that I helped in the other day.” The receptionist nods in understanding and hands me a small sticky note, on it rests a room number. I thank her before departing and making my way to the appropriate room, spotting two nurses standing outside of it. One, I immediately recognize from yesterday.

	“Excuse me?”

	“Ah, $name, am I right?” I nod. “Thanks for coming, she still hasn’t said a word to anyone since she’s been awake. We don’t know her name, age, or if she even has a family. We’re hoping, since you helped her out that she&#39;ll tell you.”
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“I’ll try my best.” The nurses nod and let me into the room. The sound of me entering perks the woman up, and I can see curiosity blazing in her amber colored eyes. We look each other over with interest, me just taking the chance to take in her appearance, and she trying to figure out the reason for my presence. There’s a glimmer in her eyes and bewilderment covers her face.

She has loose wavy black hair, currently pulled into a messy bun. The color contrasted yet went incredibly well up against her light olive skin which is riddled with bruises and a series of long-aged looking scars. Two prominent ones rest on her face, one near her right brow, and the other resting against her nose. Some of the other scars were still the color of fresh blood, causing me to wonder if she allowed the staff here to touch her at all.

But, try as I might, my attention kept going back to her eyes. They are an intense amber color that seems like they could shift to either a more brownish shade or go straight red. Even under the strained fluorescent light of the hospital, they had a bright golden tinge to them. But they weren’t soft or welcoming. Instead, they penetrated my entire being, slicing past any defenses I might’ve had up and eliminated any and all resistance.

“Um, probably not. My name is $name Roe, I was the one who found you and brought you here.”
&lt;&lt;if $trunk&gt;&gt;\

	“Oh, so it was your trunk that I was stuffed in last night?” she asks, cocking her head to the side and her eyes narrowing.
	
	“Wait, you know about that?”
	
	“I was drifting, I wasn’t unconscious. Well, I wasn’t until you took a flying leap over that one pothole.”
	
	“Yea sorry for that. But hey, it’s better than that path, right?”
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“You should’ve left me there,” she mumbles, finally breaking eye contact with me, looking outside the window now.

“Well then,” I start after clearing my throat, “how are you feeling?”

“Why does it matter?”

“Look, I’m just trying to please the nurses here. They say you won’t talk to anybody and –”

“And they brought you along in hopes that I’ll spill my guts out to you, huh? Wow, and I thought they were supposed to be smart.” I continue to stare at her, this wasn’t exactly how I pictured this going. I didn’t expect her to blurt out her life problems to me, but I did expect her to give me the gist of what happened to her, and how she ended up near my job.
&lt;&lt;if $trunk&gt;&gt;\
	
	But even I found it hard to completely trust someone who thought it a good idea to stuff me in their trunk.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“At least give me your name.”

“No,” she says in an overly aggressive tone.

“How did you end up on the path? Any family members?”
		
“What are you? An undercover cop? Who did you say you were again?”
		
“I’m just trying to help you by figuring out what happened.”
		
“Nothing that concerns you in the slightest. You don&#39;t know me, let&#39;s keep it that way.”

“Now then, if you’re done asking questions.” She swings her legs around and gets to her feet, wobbling before balancing herself. She approaches me and though she keeps distance between us, looks me over in interest.

“What are you anyway?”

“Um, a struggling college student?” I tell her, though I say so with confusion mixed in with my tone. She narrows her brows, and something causes her eyes to light up in realization. She shakes her head, moving whatever was on her mind to the back. She doesn’t say anything else, just walking towards the door with a purpose. I follow behind her, shocked to find that no one tries to stop us. That is until we get to the bottom floor and we&#39;re approached.

“Sushi?” she questions, trying her hardest to hide the smile trying to appear.
		
“You were giving me these weird looks, so I just said something totally out of the way.” She opens her mouth to answer but then closes it, appearing like she had remembered who she was talking to. She scrunches her nose up and sends me a conflicted look, filled mostly with disapproval, though I wonder if it’s more for herself than for me.

I get nothing, not even a twitch. The forest seems to have heard me though. It was silent before, but that was a hopeful silence. A silence that caused one to believe that if they continued on, then they would soon hear the birds and frogs, and the river. This silence, it was one that haunted places, that watched those who trespassed and followed them like a stalking predator.

I gaze around when I spot the body move, suddenly jerking up into the air.

The branches tighten its grasp on my uncle’s limp form.
	
“$name, how are you?” my uncle asks but his mouth moves lazily. The branches drag random limbs in erratic directions. The entire scene reminds me of a puppet show, regardless of the spine-chilling atmosphere.
	
I open my mouth to answer, or question, when the body surges towards me, my uncle’s head lazily tilting to the side. It was impossible for the figure to have any bones in his body, judging off the way that his neck was rolling from one side to the other.
	
The body stops short directly in front of me. He grinds his teeth, and his eyes move up and down my body.
	
“You’re fine. Not dead, unlike me. I’m dead!” he screams the last part, the branches pulling him back harshly. His leg gives out, and he stumbles, but his support doesn’t let him follow. It swiftly picks him back up, reprimanding him in the process.
	
“Must be nice,” he sings, chuckling as he sways from side to side. “$name, what were you thinking when you saw my dead body?”

[[&quot;Oh shit.&quot;]]
[[&quot;I wasn&#39;t thinking anything.&quot;]]

I test the weight to decide how much strength would be needed. Once I figure this out, I toss the stick at the figure. I expect the figure to dart out of the way or to even twitch in irritation. It does none of the above, it doesn’t move at all. So, I decide to throw something else.

I find another stick, some ways off from where I discovered the first. This one is smaller but will deliver the same results. I toss it towards the motionless body, jumping when the immobile body suddenly moves, jerking into the air and rotating towards me.

I once believed that the supernatural was just a bunch of stories and apparently that was false.
			
My first few steps yield no response. The still figure remains stationary, and only the branches, intertwining through the limp body, is the only sign of movement. I continue forward, almost close enough to touch the immobile body, when it suddenly jerks up into the air.

It strikes one of the crows right in the chest, sending him falling to the ground. The others don’t gaze after their fallen compatriot, they don’t move at all. The crow that I had hit uprights itself and flies back to the original perch. The only sign of it ever being hit is a growing blood stain on its chest. Like the others, it goes back to staring at me, ignoring whatever pain it might be in.

I don’t understand why, but my heart rate picks up rapidly under their gaze. Each second that passes by sees my fear escalating. Sweat dribbles down the side of my face, my hands grow clammy, my legs stiff. The crows give nothing away, nothing in their behavior has changed. The only variable that has changed is me.

I pick up another rock, unchecked rage coursing through me. As soon as I have the rock in my palm, a flash of black appears in front of me. I shriek as the crows fly around my head, cawing and pecking at me. The pain intensifies with every peck, and regardless of how many times I try to scare them away, they are unyielding. I screech as the pecks become cleverly placed: the cheek, the chest, the mouth, and the eye. I scream as loud as I can but find it to be frivolous, death sings my name.

If I did, I was sorely put out by their lack of answering, or even signs that they acknowledged my voice. They each continue to stare, their eyes piercing me.

I’m about to question them again when my eyes make contact with each crow, the words are lost. I choke on my thoughts, on the words that I was about to say. I suddenly feel very sick in my body, as if everything about me was wrong. It was an out of body experience on another level. I felt connected to my soul and felt that the body that we were inhabiting was wrong, was diseased in some way. I crumble to the ground, gasping for air, although my lungs were filled with it. I could still breathe fine, but it felt like I was suffocating.

Six eyes stare down at me. Six crows glare at me as the forest closes in.

I hear a stream and go in the general direction, noticing a large oak tree with squirrels running up its trunk. This area was so much different than the last, alive with the feeling of hope. I take a deep breath in when I begin to smell a putrid odor. I open my eyes and find myself in the middle of a desolate clearing.

Residing on each barren perch is a crow, six in all. They stare at me with bloodshot eyes. Another sniff and I realize that the odor is being secreted from them. Upon closer inspection I find their wings made of tar, melting under an unseen sun. The smell grows as they decompose, leaving nothing but empty husks. But nevertheless, dead or alive . . .

The tree holds no eyes, but I feel it watching me from all sides. I hear faint whispering, as if it was condemning me to a fate I knew nothing about. My eyes follow the branches up, higher and higher until they stop at an intricate pattern. Though I know I have never seen such a design, a strange familiarity with it overwhelms me. I reach out to touch it, growing closer and closer.

The whispers get louder, the forest awakes, the pattern stares back at me, and the limbs slither towards its prey.

“Why does anything matter? Why does my life or your life matter?”
			
“The real question.” He laughs loudly as if he didn’t believe one word I had said. His body whips around, and the branches aid him in walking towards the edge of the forest. The way he goes reminds me faintly of how a child would play with their dolls. Walking was deemed unnecessary, and instead, they would move the doll through hops.

“You’re going to die,” he chimes in, his figure disappearing until the fog swallows him. The trees disappear as well, leaving only one tree in its place.

My poor uncle. He didn’t deserve this, he didn’t deserve any of this crap. But I guess that was a tale that most people would, and could, sing. Losing him, on top of everything else, I just feel like I was being hit with multiple shocks. This stress was worse than anything that has happened in the past.

I stand up and stretch, feeling a crick in my neck and the soreness in my back. I was surprised an abandoned house had a bed still, let alone a mattress – no matter how hard. I felt like falling back to the ground though, living the rest of my existence there. It had to be better than feeling each and every ache that my body currently held.

I was a college student, I was already breaking down and screaming into my pillow every night. I was struggling enough with juggling college, a job, and the trauma from my past. And now this. Oh geez. My heart was beating frantically, and I feel a cold chill lay itself on me, though I was sweating and felt like I was about to have a heat flash. I need to breathe, desperately. I do some breathing exercises, finally feeling more like myself.

My world was the ball that never gets found, doomed to live out its life in the backyard of some old grumpy man’s house.

She looks comfortable, as if we weren’t both standing in a dilapidated house. I had on the same clothes that I wore yesterday, but here she was wearing a tank top, some loose cargo pants, and sandals. To top it all off, a large mug rests in her hands, and of course, a vulgar phrase is printed on it.

“Morning,” I mumble, and her grunt is the only indication I receive that tells me she heard me.

“I saw your bag, and there’s no way you fit all of that in there.”

“Well, duh,” she snorts, yawning immediately after, “I have stuff upstairs.” I cock my head to the side, glancing at the rickety staircase. The same kind of staircase that you would find in an extravagant adventure story, the one the hero and less than wise sidekick had to cross over. She catches my look and sighs, gulping down the rest of whatever was in her mug.

“This is one of my safehouses. What, you think I just put in a random address?”

“I did, actually. Why abandoned houses? And if you’re going to choose abandoned houses, then why not at least make them more ... presentable?”

“Does it look like I’m the type to have company? The more rundown they look, the better. I don’t need water or electricity, just a roof.”

“And mice?” I say this as I glare at one that stares back at me. Apparently, I was the intruder here.

“You get used to them,” she reassures.

[[&quot;I hope not.&quot;]]

“You’re going to stay out of my way. And keep all your thoughts and annoying questions to yourself.” I grind my teeth together as she looks back down at a heavy book in front of her. One positive to the room I had slept in and my dreams, she wasn’t in them.

I leave her to check on my phone that was charging near my things, thankfully I had a portable charger with me. But the dilemma of where I would be able to recharge the charger would soon become an issue. It was just one thing on a long list of things that I needed to figure out now.

	“I feel like I’m going to throw up. Is that all? Can you go now?” she questions, placing the money for her items in my hand. I snort, getting directions to the nearby town before leaving.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“Was that so hard?” I tease, my smirk disappearing as I look towards the door, “this is safe, right? Like I won’t be tracked down immediately, will I?”

	“You should be fine if you go straight there and back and leave your phone out of it. Are you scared, Roe?”

	“Of course I’m scared,” I grumble, ending the conversation and getting directions to the nearby town before leaving.

[[Continue-&gt;A1_3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="135" name="A1_3" tags="" position="2302,1095" size="100,100">The store is a small grocery store that looks no bigger than an average restaurant. With one quick glance around the near-empty parking lot, I came to the conclusion that this was probably all the town had to show. A gas station, a store, and a diner that rivaled the size of the store. In a town like this, I would stand out. There would be no hiding that I’m a stranger, and in a town this small, lying wouldn’t be easy. 

As soon as I walk into the store, suspicious eyes fall on me, and whispers follow me as I walk towards my first aisle. I grab the list Sydero had given me and look it over. I don’t know what I expected to see, especially since she gave me the list knowing the store would be small, but I’m not sure I expected this. She needed salt and then different colored candles, further listing the exact colors that would aid her.

[[Grab the things for Sydero.]]

&lt;&lt;set $syderolist = true&gt;&gt;

Before I go off to collect the things I need, I search for Sydero’s list of things. Salt was an easy object to acquire for obvious reasons, but the candles that she needed not as much. I grab as many candles as I can before leaving to check on my things. If I could somehow get into my apartment though, then most of my needs would be met. At the moment, there were so many things that I was feeling the loss of, my laptop for example.


I think about all the things that I had left behind as I walk to the checkout counter. It is only when I see the clerk staring at me that I come out of my thoughts. I look around, curious if I had done something wrong, but I have not.

She grabs one of the things and scans it, never breaking eye contact. A thought that hadn’t occurred to me until now arises. Who and who wasn’t supernatural creatures? Sydero stated that they hide in plain sight. So, anyone could actually be one. I eye the clerk suspiciously, and she eyes me back twice as untrustworthily.

“I’ve never seen you around here,” she starts, “you visiting family?”

“No, just passing through,” I answer. Anything else would bring up more questions. Judging by her look of disapproval, I was already unwelcomed as it is.

As soon as she rings up my last item, I hurry out of the store, freezing at the three guys surrounding my car. They gaze through the windows, attempting to spot something of value probably, or perhaps even to learn who’s it is.

“Can I help you?” I ask. They all straighten up, sizing me up immediately upon approach. They each wear worn-out jeans, outdoor boots, and plain t-shirts. They remind me of the type of guys who would rather be out fishing or hunting. The problem with that was that they were gazing at me as if I was the deer.

“This is a mighty nice car.” Despite his diction, the man actually looked as if he could command respect. His smile reminds me of a devilish coyote, one who has found his prey wounded on the side of the road. He rounds my car until he appears in front of me, his grin widening even more as his finger makes a trail along the trunk.

I ball up her list and toss it in the nearest trashcan, continuing on with my own list. I needed food, that was my main priority. Thankfully, the store had plenty of that. If I could somehow get into my apartment, then most of my needs would be met. At the moment, there were so many things that I was feeling the loss of, my laptop for example.

“We just wanna know where you got this pretty car,” one of them laughs, pushing the other roughly. His friend doesn’t seem to notice though, he was too busy glaring at me.

Out of the corner of my eye, I see the quietest one approaching, his fingers drumming his pants leg. For a brief moment, my eyes go back to who I expect the leader to be. His eyes are currently on my car, longing residing there. When he looks back at me, he gives me another wolfish grin, and I swear I see canines. Were they supernatural? Werewolves perhaps?

“Are ... are you guys ... werewolves?” The leader cocks his head to the side. The others do the same, all looking at me with curious eyes.
		
“Are you stupid or something?” one asks, smirking. His smirk disappears once he realizes that I wasn’t joking. Instead, he snorts a couple of times, looking between his more than bewildered friends.

“Wow, you&#39;re insane,” he laughs, falling back due to his laughter.

	Suddenly the leader lunges towards me. I shoot back just in time to avoid his fist. With him currently off balance, I raise my fist and deliver a punch that sends him to the ground.

		Out of the corner of my eye, I see his friend charging forward, impressive since he&#39;s managing to make no noise.

The third one keeps his distance, still trying to figure out a way to get close.
	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
		Suddenly someone collides into me, tackling me to the ground. I&#39;m just barely fast enough to throw up my arms to block a punch and then throw one on my own. The guy&#39;s upper body shoots backwards, and I toss him off of me, putting some much-needed space between them and me.

	Suddenly the leader lunges towards me. I shoot back before his fist can connect, but I’m not fast enough to dodge him entirely. His fist grazes my chin, sending my head snapping to the side and a throbbing sensation through my lower face. In response, I throw a punch of my own, successfully hitting his cheek. Out of the corner of my eye, I spot the biggest one moving towards me. There was no way I’d be able to get out of this.

	The man closest to me throws a punch, and I quickly duck and weave it. I dash to the side to not run into the path of the other man, and instead, I end up putting more space between all of them and me. Two of them dart towards me and I plan my move. And, at the perfect moment, I run between them, ducking so they couldn&#39;t grab me. I grab my grocery bags but don&#39;t take in account how fast the other men are. As soon as I grab the bags, one is there waiting for me.

“I do. Mind giving me a ride?”

My mouth opens and then closes as my mind catches up to her words. “You know, most people who need something tend to say please and generally just have a better attitude.”

“It’s not like I’m asking you to take me back to your place. This is the last thing I need, and then I’m out of your hair, //forever//.” The way in which she stresses the word &#39;forever&#39;, does not escape my notice. I raise a brow but decide upon not pushing another question that will be left unanswered, onto her.

“And where do you need to go?”

“243 Melbrook Road.” I retrieve my phone and type in the address. It wasn’t more than a ten-minute drive away, and it just so happened to be on the way to work. I look up at her from my phone, seeing her waiting impatiently for my answer.

She was an interesting one, and I couldn’t deny that my curiosity was peaked when it came to her. But that could possibly be due to me being nosy and wanting to know how she ended up on the path. The woman clears her throat, bringing me back to the decision that I hadn’t yet made.

I drive to the address that the unknown woman had given me, stopping in front of the house. I gaze around, this had to be wrong. The house that I was currently staring at looked near uninhabitable. From the state of the lawn to certain aspects of the house, clearly no one has lived here for some time. In fact, the entire neighborhood seemed deserted.
	
“Are you sure this is the right place?” I question but see that the woman was already getting out the car, “hey.”
	
“Your work here is done; you can go on with your life now. Let’s act like this never happened. I don’t know you, and you don’t know me. Alright? In fact, you never met me.” Before I can question her, she walks the short walk up to the front of the house, and then disappears.

Who was she and what was she hiding? I’ve met some interesting characters in my time, but never one like her. That pure, intense look residing in her eyes was unlike anything I’ve ever seen.

By the time I get to work, the thought of her begins to finally disappear from my mind. And as I work, she is shoved into storage along with any other stranger that I had exchanged words with.

“Have fun,” I tell the group, letting them into the laser tag arena. I was becoming a pro at being able to speculate who would win these games. And from what I was gathering while I was addressing them, they were going to be nothing but a warmup for the other team. I suppose I should go in there and help them out, but I had already played enough games to gratify my need.

I go sit down and retrieve my phone from my pocket, about to catch up on some videos when I hear a knock at the door. I freeze in my spot when I see my manager come in.

“$name, some officers would like to speak with you.” I go over all the reasons they might want to see me, my only idea was that it had something to do with the woman. But, for all I know, it was about something else entirely. I immediately stand and follow her out of the dark waiting room, going to my manager’s office where two men wait.
&lt;&lt;if $cmajor is &quot;Criminal Justice&quot;&gt;&gt;\

	I gather myself, knowing most of the officers on the force in this town due to my internship and just talking to them. They knew me just as well and knew that I would cooperate, as well as not being stupid enough to jeopardize my future due to one stranger. And yet, the two men that I find myself facing weren&#39;t familiar ones.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

They say nothing, taking the opportunity to look me over as I do the same. The two men seem like polar opposites to one another, the only thing they seem to share was muscles. The taller of the two men glare down at me with a mix of both uninterest and impatience. His body language screams that he wishes to hurry this up so he can get on with more important matters. His partner, on the other hand, is shorter and can’t seem to get rid of his small yet friendly smile. 
&lt;&lt;if $knowher&gt;&gt;\

	“Last night you found and brought a woman into the hospital. The hospital staff stated that you knew the woman, is this true?” the tallest one asks. He was the more intimidating of the two, his muscles threatening to bust out of the tight uniform that he was issued. He had dark brown intense eyes, and the fact that he was bald didn&#39;t help to give him a friendlier look. He was a dark brown skin tone with an incredibly clear complexion, and the only other thing to take note of was his well-groomed goatee.
	
	“I just followed her out.”
	
	“So, you didn’t know her?” I swallow the invisible lump in my throat, remembering her words to never speak of her again. I technically didn’t know her, she was someone that I helped out.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	
	“Last night you found and brought a woman into the hospital. The hospital staff stated that she left with you, is this true?” the tallest one asks. He was the more intimidating of the two, his muscles threatening to bust out of the tight uniform that he was issued. He had dark brown intense eyes, and the fact that he was bald didn&#39;t help to give him a friendlier look. He was a dark brown skin tone with an incredibly clear complexion, and the only other thing to take note of was his well-groomed goatee.
	
	“Yes, this is true.”
	
	“So, did you know her or was this all coincidence?” I swallow the invisible lump in my throat, remembering her words to never speak of her again. I technically didn’t know her, she was just someone that I helped out.

“I know her, but not enough to vouch for her or anything else. We talked here and there in the past.” The man frowns, no doubt he immediately saw through my lie.
		
“So, you know she is an extremely dangerous character?” I feel my palms begin to sweat, but it was too late to turn back now.
		
“Double life, I guess,” I manage to squeak out. Why was I acting so afraid all of a sudden? She was out of my life, and she hadn’t done anything to me. If anything I should be cocky since I survived.

“It’s imperative that we find her, do you know where she is?” The exact address evades me, but I’m sure my phone still held the address that she had given me. But that was if she was even there still. I look at the men, both glaring at me with unreadable expressions. If this were poker, I would undoubtedly lose.

	“No,” the officers both state and push past him, their words echoing in my mind. But I had bigger issues than the cops wanting to know about some woman that I hardly knew. My eyes move to Mr. Pinsky and my manager, one gazing at me with hatred and the other with disappointment.

&#39;&#39;Outside //The Alley// . . .&#39;&#39;

A lone man takes a long puff from his cigarette, scrunching up his nose at the smell. He actually hated these things, yet the calming and numb feeling that they offered him was much too nice to pass up. He allows his eyes to settle on the building before him. The words ‘The Alley’ were painted blue and built in an annoyingly hard to read cursive font. The entire thing was an aggravating eye sore. The man produced a low growl due to his current predicament, not perking up until he spots two familiar figures walking towards him.

“Well?”

“It’s like you thought, the kid didn’t know much. I doubt there&#39;s any kind of ties between them.” The man nods at the report, flicking the cigarette to the ground.

“What do we know?”

&lt;&lt;if $addressknown&gt;&gt;\
	“The kid gave us the address that she gave $him. Guess she needed a ride or something.” The man scrunches up his nose at the words, his eyes landing on the paper. He knew the address, heck they had just scoured the neighborhood that the house belonged to. Something was off. Why would she go back there? The only reason he could think of was that she had left something behind. Either way, it was a lead, and he would be a fool to waste it.
	
	“I’ll go check out the validity of the address, you two keep an eye on Roe.”
	
	“Why? I thought you said the kid was unimportant,” spoke the one who had barely spoken before. He was a man of a lot of words, but he wasn’t a fan of making a fool of himself. He was still trying to wrap his head around everything that was transpiring.
	
	“I said that the probability of $him not knowing anything is high, doesn’t mean we should rule out $him being an accomplice altogether.” Both officers nod as their boss turned on his heel and walked to one of the three waiting black SUV’s.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $fakeaddress&gt;&gt;\
	“The kid said that she requested to be dropped off at a nearby park. She probably was going to meet someone there.” The man scrunches up his nose at the words, stroking his beard as he thinks. Who could she possibly be meeting up with? Regardless of his doubts, it was a lead, and he would be a fool to throw it away.
	
	“I’ll go check out the validity of this, you two keep an eye on Roe.”
	
	“Why? I thought you said the kid was unimportant,” spoke the one who had barely spoken before. He was a man of a lot of words, but he wasn’t a fan of making a fool of himself. He was still trying to wrap his head around everything that was transpiring.

&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $lieaddress&gt;&gt;\
	“The kid said that $he has no idea where she went, she left as soon as they left the hospital.” With all the information, and experience, he had surrounding her, he could believe this more than anything else. True, she was a resourceful person, but she was a loner above all else. This was both a good and bad thing when it came to his job. It meant that detaining her should be easy, but to apprehend her they had to find her, and she was as slippery as they were determined.

	I had learned something new today, a lesson that any other person would say should be one of common sense. Don’t key a random person’s car, you never know who it could belong to. I suppose it was an idiotic thing to do in the first place, certainly not worth losing my job over. Now I would have to look for another job, one that paid half as well as this one.
	
	As I pack the things I kept in my locker, Chris pokes his head into the room.
	
	“So, it’s true, you got busted?”
	
	[[&quot;Darn cameras.&quot;]]
	[[&quot;Good riddance.&quot;]]
	[[&quot;Indeed, I have been let go.&quot;]]

	[[&quot;It&#39;s whatever.&quot;]]
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	After the two officers leave, my manager makes the decision to let me go early. It could be because she was worried about my own personal health or just didn’t want customers questioning, maybe even a mix of both. Either way, the choice didn’t affect my paycheck, so I didn’t complain. Instead, I quickly gather the few things I had sat down and leave before she has the chance to change her mind.
	
	As I head towards my car, I hear Chris call out for me.

	&quot;So it&#39;s true, you&#39;re abandoning me?&quot; he questions, wiping away an invisible tear.
	
	[[&quot;You&#39;ll be okay, it&#39;s only one day.&quot;]]

“You should definitely come by now and complain about the service like some grumpy customer.”
	
“No thanks, I know first-hand how annoying they are, and I wouldn’t put you guys through that.” Chris nods in understanding and walks me out to my car, helping me pack the few things up.
	
“Tomorrow, we celebrate your, uh, newfound freedom.”
	
“Sure, if you’re offering to pay.” He nods and sends me a farewell wave, speed walking back inside to avoid getting into trouble himself. I’m about to get in my car when I see Mr. Pinsky’s car just a few feet away.

I speak about finals and rant about my professor and the one class that I’m worried about. The entire time he listens to what I say, interjecting every now and then with a question or a funny statement.

As the conversation begins to end, I spot him bite the side of his lip, a tell of his that I had learned some time ago. He only did it when he wished to ask something that might be taken the wrong way.

“And what’s this?”
		
&quot;Another one of your favorite t-shirts,” I say, showing him. He grins from ear to ear, accepting the shirt and laying it on the arm of the couch. I will never understand his obsession with these things, but if they made him happy, then I suppose it didn’t matter much.
		
“I thank you, Wise One, for the shirt. But what happened yesterday?”

“I ended up having to help this woman that I found next to my job, I still don’t know what happened to her. But yea, I was kept at the hospital for a while, and by the time they let me go, it was way too late.” He nods in 
understanding.

“Do you know if she’s okay at least?” My mind goes to the scene that she had pulled at the hospital.

“Oh yea, definitely fine. No sign of trauma or anything.”

“Well, count your blessings, huh?” he offers with a shrug, “anything new happening?”

	“Yep, I lost my job today.” He studies me for a minute, after realizing that I was serious he sighs and hangs his head.

He feared that talking about it would keep the wound open, never allowing it to close and heal properly.

“And? Any episodes? Is everything still okay?” I keep any emotion from my face, but I can’t help but think about the creature that rested in my dreams.

I appear on a foggy street, a lone streetlight flickering before deciding that it’ll work for the time being. Rows of decaying houses stand on both sides of the road, unmanicured lawns enjoying their freedom. The only sound is that of a distant dog, continually barking at some unseen force. I search for the dog, and even try to go in the direction I believe the barking originates from, but always end up back where I began.

I walk down the street, feeling as if I was walking in place, but the houses shift. The feeling is surreal, even for a dream. Was it natural to know one is dreaming but not be able to control it? To be completely mystified and unaware of what was happening?

I continue down the street when I see a lone figure standing in the middle of the road, her black wavy hair immediately catching my attention. This was definitely the woman from earlier. I continue to approach her still body, cautiously closing the distance between us. Once I&#39;m close enough, she picks up her head, her eyes wide in terror. They don’t seem to be staring at me, but through me. She stays like this, and despite my attempts at getting her attention, she doesn’t move.

Suddenly, her body is pointed directly at me, her fingers gripping my arms and squeezing. If this were real, then she would have punctured flesh, drawing blood. Her eyes are now bloodshot, staring past my physical body and at my soul. She opens her mouth to say something when suddenly her body jolts backward, falling to the street in a heap. A blood puddle forms around her, growing larger by the second. 

Again, the world is quiet, other than the distant barks of a dog.

The next morning, I roll out of bed near noon. I make a hot breakfast, rubbing my temples as I inhale the scent of french toast repeatedly. Despite the delightful aroma, it does little to rid my mind of last night’s dream.

It was just a dream, right? Of little importance. Despite these words, I still find myself rubbing the area that the woman had grabbed hold of, it all felt so real and still did. Could it be a message, something actually 
meaningful?

I sip my apple juice, desperately trying to forget the dream but finding it impossible. This was going to haunt me for the rest of the day, unless ...

My uncle had already left for work, so explaining where I was going wasn’t needed. I grab my keys and bring up the address that she had given me. For all I know, she wouldn’t even be there, she was probably long gone. But still, checking was harmless. I get into my car and head out.
	
I turn a corner when I notice a car behind me, attempting to seem nonchalant but ultimately following me. Maybe it was just my nerves, it wasn’t like I wasn’t on edge already due to that dream, as well as thoughts concerning the shadow creature. I was having one heck of a week, I didn’t wish to add paranoia to the mix.
		
I take a few random turns, pissing my GPS off as I do so. I take notice of the car that continues to trail me. I even go in a circle and through it all, there it is. If I ever complained about the un-excitement of my life, I take it all back now.

When I arrive at my apartment, I’m still thinking about the dream, despite my attempts. I absentmindedly play with my keys as I walk, accidentally running into someone. I begin to apologize when they grab me. I look up in shock, the officer from yesterday standing there.
		
“You’re coming with us.&quot;

		“You want another permanent scar to haunt you for the rest of your life? If not, then you’ll behave.” I narrow my eyes, hoping to come off as intimidating but knowing by his smirk that I was failing. I grumble and relax partially, allowing him to pull me after him. He walks me to my car, forcing me to hand over the keys, before pushing me into the passenger&#39;s seat. Perhaps it was a petty and unimportant thing to think of at the moment, but no one has ever driven my baby but me. Seeing him get into the driver’s seat causes a ripple of anger to travel through me. Though I’m not able to explore it much, as the cop&#39;s partner joins us.

	“Langston, you wanna move your ass or are you still sightseeing?” the man growls, motioning for him to come on.
	
	“You need to seriously learn how to live life Petri, you’re going to die early if not,” his partner replies. This was the &#39;always smiling&#39; one. He was much shorter than his partner and starkly different. First off, his skin was peachy white and he had hair, even though it was short and receding in some places. He had warm grey eyes, and paired with his smile, seemed very inviting. I can easily see these two interrogating someone and playing good cop, bad cop. Langston gets into the seat behind me.

Fear that caused me to question if death would be a better substitute. This fear, it was more of a nervousness. At best, it created a chill that rushes through my body.

	I look in the rearview mirror, the truck was now trailing behind me by two cars. I ponder my next move.

	“Enough!” Petri shouts. His hand shoots out and clasps around my neck, squeezing tight enough for me to see the need to fight back, but Langston reaches around the seat and quickly subdues my arms. “Let me tell you how this is going to work, cos I’m low on patience. We’re going to drive to the address, and you’re going to act like you’re running away from us.”
	
	“No need to act,” Langston chuckles softly.
	
	“Once she comes to rescue you, we’ll have her.”
	
	“And what will you do with me?”
	
	“Depends on your acting skills.” He produces a growl so animalistic that I begin to believe the man was raised by dogs. He releases me, and I take several deep breaths, relishing the feeling of air entering my lungs once again.

		Thirty minutes later and I find myself driving down a familiar neighborhood. It looks exactly how it did the other day, I’m not sure why I would’ve believed it to look any different.
		
		With my paranoia as high as it is, I decide to park the car three houses down from the property I remember dropping the woman off at. I place a rock under the garage door, allowing me to hide the vehicle from view but not totally lock it up.
	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
		Thirty minutes later and I find myself driving down unfamiliar streets. The houses mock me as I get deeper, their age reflecting off of their cracked windows and rotting wood.

	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
	
	As I back away, I believe I see a shadow flash out of the corner of my eye, but after inspection, find nothing there.
	
	“You’re in a creepy, abandoned neighborhood, you’ve just been chased by a truck, and you’re visiting a complete stranger that has the cops looking for her,” I start to remind myself as I go, “you’re allowed to be paranoid.” I take a few reassuring breaths but find that the effort is useless.
	
	The vibe I was getting was different than what I had been expecting. I felt more depressed than frightened, perhaps due to the sun&#39;s positioning in the sky, giving me a clear and beautiful view of everything. The idea that these houses, this neighborhood, was once alive with energy, now void of it all. It was also interesting to imagine how the neighborhood might’ve looked in its prime, how neighbors treated one another. I smile at the thought of children riding their bikes up and down the streets, dogs barking, and the joyful yet annoying sound of an ice-cream truck.
	
	I re-open my eyes, whatever the past held, the present has long forgotten. Unmanicured lawns and yards filled with an assortment of trash, all leading up to vandalized houses.

	But I wasn’t here to explore a street long overlooked by others. I turn, and my eyes fall on the house, 243 Melbrook Road. I approach the door cautiously, against my better judgment I knock. For all I know she could be gone, or someone else could be here. I jiggle the knob and find the door unlocked, entering and finding myself standing in a small foyer. 

	Debris litters the floor, and a tall lamp with holes in its shade stands to the side. A small table with three legs rests perched up against the wall, but that is all that pulls my attention. I walk further into the house. A set of stairs leading up to the second floor sits beside an open arch that I presume leads to the kitchen. The room I’m standing in seems to be the living room, the furnishing that was left behind had all been pushed to the side so that a collection of symbols could be made there. In the middle of one symbol rests a bowl, an assortment of objects resting inside.

I need to act like I wasn’t totally freaking out at the moment. The only way I could think of keeping that lie up was by finding a decently crowded gas station and going inside. It takes a few gas stations, but finally see one with only one open parking spot. 

I park off to the side and get out, looking at the truck out of the corner of my eye. They park in one of the spaces next to the gas pump, but no one gets out. The windows are far too tinted for me to even hope to make out a face. Thankfully, a handful of customers are milling about.

I inattentively browse a few of the shelves, attempting to figure out what my next move will be. Each idea that springs into my head is immediately put down by logic. Frustration racks my features as I gaze outside at the truck. Another car has pulled in, waiting patiently behind them since all the other pumps are full of cars.

[[Get something while here.]]

&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
I increase my speed and think about all of the most crowded streets in the area. Thankfully, it was still early enough in the morning that others were still attempting to get to work. It takes two traffic lights and many angry drivers for the truck to get stuck in traffic. I take a few more unnecessary turns, just to be sure, before using the GPS to go to the address.

&lt;&lt;set $candychipssoda = true&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
I let my eyes roam over the selection and decide to go with my favorite cheap candy, some chips, and a soda.

“Will this be all for you?” the clerk asks me, and I nod, but most of my attention is still on the truck. The car behind them has blown his horn two times already.

“Thanks,” I say and grab the food and drink.

Once I get outside, the person in the car has had enough. They march to the truck’s window and bang on it, cussing them out. This was my chance. I pick up my pace and head to my car, hoping that luck was on my side.
			
As I start my car, I see the truck attempting to pull out but forced to sit still due to a vehicle backing out of a space. I laugh to myself as I quickly pull out and drive towards a nearby neighborhood, randomly turning whenever I can. By the time I get anywhere near the address, I see no sign of the black truck.

I go over to some of the symbols. I wasn’t an expert on the topic, but it didn’t look like demonic symbols. I knew enough to know what reversed pentagrams meant and looked like. The symbols remind me more of Native American origin, as well as witchcraft. But I can’t put a name to any of them.

“What is this?” I ask aloud, picking up a small white and brown stick.
	
“Are you hard of hearing?” a familiar snarky voice questions. I look up to see the woman leaning on the rail of the staircase, staring down at me. “What part of //forget// did you not understand?”
	
“What is this?” I ask again. I dust some of the stick off, finding that its exact color was mostly a light grey.
	
“That would be a two-month-old baby bone.” Her words immediately cause me to drop it, backing away from the bowl in fear.
	
“What is this? Demonic worship?”
	
“Not so much,” she chuckles, walking down the remaining stairs, “what are you doing here Roe?”
	
“First answer my question.”
	
“Or what?”

&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
I approach the wooden bowl that sits there, crouching down beside it to get a better look. It all seems to be sitting in some kind of liquid, the other ingredients making it hard for me to tell what the fluid is though. Many of the items seem to be herbs or plants, others I can’t say.

“Hello?” I call out, wondering if I should announce who I was. A stranger wouldn’t care one way or another, but if the woman were still here, it would probably mean the difference between her running and staying.
			
“It’s me, $name, from yesterday. I helped you out of the hospital.” I hear no sound; the house seems just as empty as the rest of the neighborhood.

I wander over to the wooden bowl that sits in the middle of the room, and crouch down beside it to get a better look. It all seems to be sitting in some kind of liquid, the other ingredients making it hard for me to tell what the fluid is though.

I move to stand when I feel his shoe collide with my stomach. I gasp, all the air escaping my lungs as I cry out in pain.

Did I not say I’d cooperate? I shake the thought from my mind and try to stand again, but Langston is still one step ahead of me. He grabs my collar tightly and slams his fist into my cheek and then my eye, letting me go a minute after.

Woozy on my feet, I fall to the ground and attempt to collect myself, watching as spots of blood drip down to the cement beneath me.

“If you’re so hungry, then just ask the boss if you can have our chauffeur here.” I stiffen, feeling Petri’s eyes move to me. The atmosphere in the car goes from uncomfortable to aggressive. My hair stands as I get the feeling that I’m being hunted.

“You know, Langston, you just might have a point,” he snickers.

“Great, now be a good boy or no treat.”

“Really, dog jokes?”

“You’ve been stuck with me for years; the werewolf jokes will never end.” Only half of me continues to listen to their casual conversation. Werewolf. They were kidding, right? They had to be. But that wasn’t something you’d just drop in conversation, not even to further freak someone out. My mind goes back to Petri’s growls and how I currently feel like prey. No, I was looking too deep into this.

	Thirty minutes later, I park the car in front of our destination, cutting the engine. I wipe sweat from my brow, not even knowing that so much had accumulated. 
	
	“Now go in there and act like you’re being chased after,” Petri tells me, his eyes on the house as well.
	
	“This should be easy, it’s not really an act at all,” Langston chuckles.
	
	“Is that all I need to do?”
	
	“Yep. Just get her to come outside.” Petri takes his phone out of his pocket, motioning for me to go. I open the door when Petri grips my arm roughly.
	
	“Do anything that I don’t like, like trying to warn her, and I’ll rip you to shreds.”
	
	“Believe him,” Langston speaks up, “he has supernatural hearing and senses in general.” They were continuing on this supernatural creature trip then. I involuntarily swallow the lump in my throat and nod. Petri releases me but leaves a light bruise in his wake. 
	
	I start walking, glancing back at the car before realizing that it wasn’t a smart move. I need to act like I was here alone, probably act frantic and desperate. I nod at my own plan, picking up my pace and then pounding on the door.
	
	“Please, help me! They’re after me now!” I scream at the door. “I know you can help me, just ... please. I don’t wanna die!” Was I laying it on a bit too much? Should I try to act composed or continue like this? I bang on the door a second time, even trying the handle when it suddenly jerks open. I stand at the threshold of the house, hardly making out the figure of the woman that I had met the other day. She stands at the side of the door, residing purely in the shadows. The only reason I can make out her facial details is because of the sunlight that was being allowed to stream in.
	
	“You’re not a clever one, are you? So, what’s this about you needing help?”
	
	“Men are after me,” I tell her, motioning to my roughed-up appearance.
	
	“They wouldn’t be if you had just done what I said. Remember I did say forget me.”
	
	[[Try to warn her.]]
	[[Continue trying to get her out in the open.]]
	[[Just ... plead.]]
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;
	“I still see no point in telling a complete stranger my reason for doing anything,” she finally tells me.
	
	“Would you not be curious if you walked in on me doing this?” I point to the symbols.
	
	She shrugs nonchalantly, “I would’ve never come back to find you.”
	
	“Then there’s that whole &#39;black truck following me&#39; ordeal,” I continue to say, still believing it was pure luck that I lost them.

	“Wait, black truck? Did you see who was inside?”

	“No, everything was tinted.”

	“And you led them here?” she asks and walks to the window, looking out of it. For the first time since I’ve met her, she seems scared.

	“No. I lost them and parked my car two houses down.” If she hears me, I can’t tell. She leaves my side and goes into what I had already guessed to be the kitchen. I follow after her, watching as she picks up a bookbag stowed away in the corner and then setting it on the counter. She begins to go through counters, and much to my surprise actually brings down some water and other non-perishable items.

	“What are you doing?”

	“I’m getting out of here.”

	“Wait, why?” 

	“You know, you ask a lot of questions.”

	“And you haven’t answered any of them.”

	“What can I say, it’s a curse,” she chuckles sarcastically. Whether it was my intolerance for the moment, or just my total confusion of the situation, that smirk of hers was grating my nerves. It constantly reminds me that I know little and will continue to be left in the dark.

	She goes back to what she was doing, it is as if I had disappeared entirely from the house. Obviously, I wasn’t going to get anything from her. This was a waste of both gas and time.

“Alright, calm down,” she begins, taking a cautious step towards me as I hyperventilate.
			
“How can I calm down?”
			
“If you’re this prone to episodes, then you should’ve stayed away,” she grumbles, just loud enough for me to make out her words. Once I calm down enough to breathe regularly, she re-asks her question about my presence.

“The cops showed up and said that you were a dangerous character and that they needed to find you.”

“Dangerous character, huh? And you still came?” she questions, taking a threatening step closer to me. She was now inches away from me, and I felt it impossible to break the eye contact that she had started.

“Good thing I’m not a cat. Look, I just want answers. The cops said that you were an extremely dangerous character when they questioned me about you. And this house isn’t helping your case.”

She straightens up, a new look appearing in her eye.
			
“What kind of dream?”
		
&quot;You were on the streets outside and there was no sound besides some dogs barking. As I walked down the street, you were there, and you had grabbed me in this killer grip. You were going to say something but never were able to, you suddenly just got thrown back, and you died.”

“Dogs barking,” she says to herself, her eyes widening in realization. Is that the part she was the most curious about, some random dogs?

“Why would you though,” she asks, I barely know what she’s saying when she suddenly looks at me. There is no hint of her telling me what’s going on in her eyes.

“Come on,” I start, “I answered your question and to be honest I’m just really confused. The cops said you were extremely dangerous when they questioned me about you.”

The look in her eyes drifts from one of danger to one of interest. The corners of her mouth perk up to form a smirk as she looks me up and down. Before her face can portray anything more, she takes a step back and places her disinterested mask back on.

My eyes roam to the ground, again spotting one of those unknown symbols. I was becoming quite queasy about all the things that my mind chose to claim the marking was. This was stupid. Had I truly forgotten that the cops themselves were after her? What did I get myself into?

“I know, and you were right, and I’m stupid to think that they wouldn’t come after me,” I tell her and raise my eyebrows at her. She cocks her head to the side in curiosity, amusement evident in her features. I try everything I can think of as I continue to try and get her to come out. I wink, blink uncontrollably, and even try to mouth my warning. She laughs at me, shaking her head as she closes the door slowly. Right before it closes, I hear her whisper.
			
“You can stop the act, I already know they’re out there.” I freeze, wondering if that’s why she never came into full view.
			
“I have to give you props on trying to warn me though, that was quite ... shocking.” I bang on the door, jiggling the handle, hoping to keep up the act for those watching me.
			
“So, does that mean you’ll help me?” I question, relieved that at least that line wouldn’t give away my true intentions, “otherwise I’m dead.” There is silence from her side, and I begin to worry that she won’t, that perhaps she’s going to leave me to my fate.
			
“Sure.” The door suddenly opens up, and her arm shoots out, grabbing me as she pulls me in. As she does this, I hear shouting. Though there are multiple voices, I only make out Petri and Langston’s, both yelling at me.

“$name Roe, come out now,” I hear Petri shout in rage. Whether or not I trust or even think I have a chance of escaping this madness, I’m for sure not going back out there. Suddenly the glass breaks, and the two of us instinctively duck as more shouting from outside is now audible. The woman leaves my side and messes with a bowl in the middle of what I perceive to be the living room. She quickly grabs a bag and then grabs my hand as she rushes from the house through the back door.
	
“Wait, what happened?” We’re forced to slow down as we try to navigate the thickness of the plants and long grass.
	
“Just know that we need to get to your car as fast as possible. When I say go, we’re going to sprint to the car, keep your eyes closed.” I’m about to ask why when the house explodes in a blinding light ... just like the one I saw at The Alley. Was ... was she responsible for those that day?
	
I manage to close my eyes just as they begin to feel an atrocious burning sensation. Not quite sure how the woman does it, but she yanks me onwards, and before long we’re back in my car and driving off. I don’t look back, out of fear that the light is still there. I feel like I’ve poured every soap known to man straight in my eyes.

After we get away, we switch, and she lets me drive. But being behind the wheel without being threatened does little to calm my nerves or soothe my racing heart. So many things had just occurred, and where I thought some of my questions would be answered, hundreds more seem to have replaced them. It gets so bad that I’m forced to pull over. Not only because of a headache but also due to the need for answers.

“Come on, please, they’re just over here.” I move from my position and run a few steps away, motioning for her to follow desperately.

“Sure, let me get my bag really quick,” she says in a tone I’m not familiar with her using. Of course, I hardly know her, but her tone has me raising a cautionary brow. She sees my expression and busts out laughing, wiping away an invisible tear as she closes the door.

“Wait, no please!” I shout, dashing back to the door and banging on it in desperation.

“Drop the act, I already know what’s going on and whose watching. Cute act though.”

“So that’s it? You’re just going to condemn me to death?” I question, not being able to stop the anger that seeps into my voice. But why exactly was I angry? Who was I even mad at?

There is silence from her side, and I begin to worry that she won’t help me, that perhaps she’s going to leave me to my fate.

“Maybe.” The door suddenly opens up, and her arm shoots out, grabbing me as she pulls me in. As she does this, I hear shouting. Though there are multiple voices, I only make out Petri and Langston’s, both yelling at me.

“But maybe not.”

“$name Roe, come out now,” I hear Petri shout in rage. Whether or not I trust or even think I have a chance of escaping this madness, I’m for sure not going back out there. Suddenly the glass breaks, and the two of us instinctively duck as more shouting from outside is now audible. The woman leaves my side and messes with a bowl in the middle of what I perceive to be the living room. She quickly grabs a bag and then grabs my hand as she rushes from the house through the back door.

“Please, just help me. I’m sorry, okay?” I practically scream, realizing that I wasn’t really acting anymore. If this woman could help me, whether by being caught or by actually helping me out, then so be it. She closes the door slowly, laughing as she does. Right before it closes, I hear her whisper.

“Continue the act, I know they’re out there.” I freeze, wondering if that’s why she never came out from the shadows, she’s known what was going on this entire time.

“I would say your acting is great, but your appearance says otherwise.”

“So, does that mean you’ll help me?” I question, stuttering as I ask the question, “otherwise I’m dead.” There is silence from her side, and I begin to worry that she won’t help me, that perhaps she’s going to leave me to my fate.

“Sure.” The door suddenly opens up, and her arm shoots out, grabbing me as she pulls me in. As she does this, I hear shouting. Though there are multiple voices, I only make out Petri and Langston’s, both yelling at me.

We both knew what I was doing, but I suppose asking the question was her way of breaking the overmounting tension in the car.

“I’m not going anywhere till I get some answers.”

“Fine. I’ll hitchhike,” she chuckles triumphantly, and I lock the door. She unlocks it, but I again lock it back. We go back and forth with this petty game, seeing which one of us would give up first. Perhaps any other day I would, the stress and irritation beating out my curiosity. But this was pure madness, I could play this game for the next week and not be tired. She shouts in frustration and leans back in the seat.

“Let me rephrase, //you’re// not going anywhere till I get some answers. Like who are those guys and what do they want? And what happened back there? And you never told me about what happened to you in the alleyway, or –”

“Take a breather, would you,” she scowls, “fine. You want answers, and I have them. But let’s start with the basics, you need to understand that monsters are real, supernatural creatures – all real. Every little story you’ve ever heard about, every creepy thing, it’s real ... except for the boogie man. That’s a legend that backfired on parents trying to get their children to stop stuffing crap underneath their beds.”

“And you expect me to believe that?”

“I really don’t care what you believe. But why would I sit here and lie to you, about that anyway? There’s no point. It&#39;d be simpler, not to mention quicker, to just tell you I&#39;m a double agent being hunted by the mafia.”

“So, you’re telling me that vampires, werewolves, ghosts, faeries, they’re all real?”

“There’s way more than that, but yea.”

[[“So why don’t I ever hear about them?”-&gt;E1Q1]]
[[“These supernatural creatures look like us, I mean regular humans?”-&gt;E1Q2]]
[[“So what happened to you in the alleyway?”-&gt;E1Q3]]

“Again, nice talk,” I say, remembering our talk from the hospital. She continues on, ignoring me. I leave the kitchen when I hear her quietly say, “do you hear that?” I stop, trying to figure out what she’s talking about, and that is when I hear the clear sound of a nearby car.

“Yea, it sounds like a car.” My words catch up with me, what would a car be doing in an abandoned neighborhood? We stand frozen as the sounds of more cars join in. We both race to the nearest window at the same time, gazing out of it in curiosity.

Three black cars now appear outside, a group of people in all black standing in front of them, their eyes on the house.
	
“Shit,” she growls, “thanks for leading them here.”
	
&lt;&lt;if $addressknown&gt;&gt;\
	“There’s no proof I even led them here,” I remind her, mentioning that my car is three houses down and the garage I had parked in is down. “They probably just came cos I told the cops your location.” The woman bites the inside of her cheek and clenches her eyes closed. She takes numerous breaths in before pushing past me roughly. Of course, her knowing that I gave her location away wasn’t going to be something she would be happy about.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“There’s no proof I even led them here,” I remind her, mentioning that my car is three houses down and the garage I had parked in is down. She taps her foot repeatedly against the floor, biting the inside of her cheek as she focuses on one splatter of dirt on the torn curtains. Suddenly she brushes past me, heading back into the previous room.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

I watch her go before looking back out the window, noticing two recognizable officers. They were the same cops that had questioned me, never in a million years would I forget their faces, especially the tall dark-skinned bald one.
	
“I recognize two of them,” I tell her, and she looks up at me.
	
“Is that supposed to make me feel better?”
	
&lt;&lt;if $addressknown&gt;&gt;\
	“No,” I say and walk over to her. She erases a few of the symbols and scribbles down new ones, these I don’t recognize either.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“No,” I begin, walking over to her. She erases a few of the symbols and scribbles down new ones, these I don’t recognize either. “But how did they find me. They have no idea where you are.”
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

She ignores my questioning, settling back near the bowl.

If I didn’t know better, I’d say she was proud. But that could be my mind hallucinating, it was in a stage of utter befuddlement.

“I can’t help it, I like dropping the hammer,” she chuckles at her own joke, though I fail to see the humor in what she says.

“Gimme your hand.” I hardly hear her, giving her my hand just because I make out valuable parts of the command. My mind is still trying to grasp her words. She didn’t say werewolves, she couldn’t.

“Alright. I need your blood to get us out of here. How about you look away and I do what needs to be done and wrap it with some thick gauze? You need to trust me right now.”

I don’t fight her or step back. She hovers it over the bowl and squeezes it, a few drops dripping down onto the items that she had chosen to leave in the bowl.

	Her gaze lingers on my arm, no doubt looking at the burn marks that appear as long gloves. I half expect her to ask how I received such a marking, but she doesn’t.

“There are some bandages in my bag, wrap the cut up.”

Suddenly the glass breaks, the two of us instinctively ducking as the shouting from outside is now audible. She sets the bowl in the middle and quickly grabs her bag, grabbing my hand as she rushes from the house through the back door.
	
“Wait what happened?” We’re forced to slow down as we try to navigate the thickness of the plants and long grass.

“Just know that we need to get as far away as possible. Where’d you say you parked?” We switch, this time I lead her. I turn to ask her about what was supposed to happen when the house explodes in a blinding light ... just like the one I saw at The Alley. Was ... was she responsible for those that day?

I’m forced to look away, due to the sheer intensity that the light gives off. It was like staring at the sun directly on the brightest and clearest day. I can only imagine what happens to those who are captured in the light.

With help from her, we are able to escape, but I’m no less jumpy than I was before. So many things have just occurred, and where I thought some of my questions would be answered, hundreds more seem to have replaced it. It gets so bad that I’m forced to pull over. Not only because of a headache but also due to the need for answers. She said she would give them, and I was ready for the truth.

“Oh please, don’t flatter yourself.” She stands, her height dwarfing my own by a few inches. Just enough to where I had to angle my head to see all of her.
			
“You’re damn lucky we’re both in the same situation, or I’d leave you to your own fate,” she growls and goes to grab the bowl. She then pushes past me and walks to the door. “You’re also lucky I know what I’m doing.”

I hear her whisper words, in a language that was foreign to my ears.

But what if witches were what Salem painted them out to be? People with unique abilities? How dangerous was she, the girl with no name?

I glance in my rearview to see if he’ll follow. He cuts his lights on and proves that today, I&#39;m that unlucky fool. I wouldn’t be able to outrun him with all these other cars. I look over at the woman, and she rolls her eyes and looks out the window.
	
	I glance at the officer and relax partially, I knew him and he knew me well enough. Once he gets to me I greet him and explain to him why I was speeding, pleading and using our relationship. The officer sends me off with nothing but a disappointed warning. Either way, I still had time and no ticket.

I run up the driveway to my uncle’s house, preparing to bang on the door when I find it already unlocked. My entire world freezes, as I push it further open, silence residing on the other side. I head inside, checking the living room and then the kitchen. Nothing was out of place, it was the same as I had left it.

“Recalculate!” I scream at my phone, though it was already thinking about a different route, “damn it hurry up.” To my surprise, the woman, who has yet to tell me her name, doesn’t say anything. She’s gazing out the window, shaking her head as she mumbles something underneath her breath.
		
The phone finally does as I ask, giving me a new route and renewed hope as I surge down the street.

	“How do I get there?” She fiddles with my phone before setting it down, navigation showing me all the routes, I was coming up on the turn to the trail.

	“How do I get there?” She fiddles with my phone before setting it down, navigation showing me all the routes, I was coming up on the turn to the trail. I take it, and before long we’re taking a much more scenic view. Due to my car’s inability to actually handle this kind of terrain, the scenic route proves worse than the street one. Numerous times my car gets stuck, and other times it just feels like we’re not even moving.
	
	My sarcastic companion only makes the matter worse when she gets out of the car and begins walking, showing how slow I was going. The time practically doubles before we get to our destination.

I think about all the options she told me about, the smartest is to just stay on the current street. Taking a backroad allows me to go faster, but I know this city and that backroad connects to a lot of streets. This all means that it was a hotspot for State Troopers who work the area, as well as more local officers. Taking it would just be a guaranteed ticket. Off-road wasn’t too bad, but for all I know the terrain would slow me down.

My GPS recalculates after the missed turn and with renewed hope, I surge down the street.

	I take it, accelerating as we get further down the street. My eyes drift to the speedometer coming up close to the one hundred mark.
	
	“How fast can this baby go?” my guest asks, smirking as she leans over to see.
	
	“I actually don’t know. If this were a Hellcat or a Demon, then it would be faster.” If it was possible, her smirk widens.
	
	Out of the corner of my peripheral, I see the standard colors of a police cruiser, waiting for some unlucky fool. I pass him, increasing speed just a bit more. I glance in my rearview to see if he’ll follow. He cuts his lights on but a moment later cuts them back off. He was smart, there was no way he’d catch up in time.

It would be okay. My uncle was okay, the house was okay, there was nothing to worry about. It was getting late, for all I know my uncle had just retired to his bed early. It wasn’t unheard of, and if his day was tough, then it was actually expected. There were no signs of forced entry, no signs of a struggle existing, and the house was silent.

It would be okay.

	I make my way up the stairs, slowing down when I spot a red mark on one of the stairs. It could’ve been overlooked on a typical day, almost doing a perfect job of blending in with the cherry wood. But I was on guard for things like this. I blink a few times, rubbing my eyes, and mentally telling my heart to slow down its rapid beating.
	
	“Uncle?” I ask in a shaky voice, going further up the stairs. I see another print on the railing, followed by a trail of thick blood that was done oozing off the side.
	
	“Matheus?!” I scream, dashing up the rest of the stairs and charging to his bedroom door. I turn the knob, but the door refuses to budge, something on the other side blocking my entry.
	
	&lt;&lt;if $athleticism &gt;= 10&gt;&gt;\
		“Uncle Matheus?” I shout, bracing myself and counting to three. Once I hit three, I turn the knob, at the same time as slamming into the door with all of the force I can muster. The door opens up easily, and I stumble inside.	
	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
		“Uncle Matheus?” I shout, bracing myself and counting to three. Once I hit three, I turn the knob, at the same time as slamming into the door with all of the force I can muster. The door budges, but I’m no closer than I was before. I repeat the process numerous of times, ignoring the pain that flees up my side. Finally, the door opens, and I stumble inside.
	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
	
	I scream in both surprise and horror at the sight. My uncle’s room was trashed, from the wall to the floor. Bloody handprints decorate the walls along with a few small and large divots. The room had been remodeled with the dresser on its side and blocking the closet, the mattress resting up against a wall, and broken glass scattered across the floor. Written on a wall were the words: You’re Next.
	
	Try as I might, I can’t fight where my eyes travel to next. Hanging from a ceiling fan hangs my uncle, his eyes wide open and lacerations rest all across his body. What was once flawed skin was now waxy and turning an unnatural purple hue. One clean tear in the stomach area caused for his entrails to dangle out, clinging to a dead body. Most of his lower body, and the floor, was painted red by his still fresh blood. Some specks still dripping off of his shoes, though the sound of them hitting the puddle was drowned out by my cries.
	
	“Uncle Matheus!” I hear someone scream, wondering if it was me, but I wasn’t sure. I don’t remember opening my mouth or screaming anything. I can’t even sense what I’m doing, if I was walking or standing or on the ground.
	
	[[Bring him down.]]
	[[Remain where I am.]]
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	I head towards the stairs when I hear a door close. I glance up to see my uncle appearing, bewildered to see me there.
	
	“Guess I didn’t lock the door. But I wasn’t expecting you, $name. What are you doing here?”
	
	“No time to explain. Grab that travel suitcase you always use and some essentials and come on.”
	
	“Why?”
	
	“Please, Uncle Matheus, I know this is completely weird and scary but just go get a suitcase and come on. We don’t have time.” He stares at me suspiciously before agreeing, turning and heading to his room. I stand in my spot for a few more seconds before walking back outside, heading towards the woman.
	
	She leans up against my car, her eyes scouring the neighborhood. There was enough light still out that if anyone suspicious were to show up, we would see them before they probably saw us.
	
	I sigh once I&#39;ve made it to her side, leaning on the side of my car as well, “anything?”
	
	“No.”
	
	“Why do you say it like that’s a bad thing?”

	“I’m not used to things going according to plan. Any minute now they’ll show up and finish what they started.”
	
	[[&quot;How long have you been on the run?&quot;]]
	[[&quot;Maybe your luck is changing.&quot;]]

I stumble towards him, feeling my body shake uncontrollably but not knowing how to stop it. I absentmindedly begin to undo the rope, until it’s loose. I hear a thud and then another, my body collapsed on the ground right next to my uncle&#39;s. But my eyes stay on the wall in front of me, my body still trying to get its bearings back.

I feel the presence of another behind me, and I glance up to see the woman looking around the room, her eyes landing on my uncle last. She examines him for a minute from her spot, before her eyes travel down and meet mine. With nothing but a blink, she turns on her heel and marches out of the room.
	
“So, you just walk away?” I scream, finally finding my voice. I get to my feet and go after her, stopping her before she could travel down the stairs.
	
“You catch on pretty quick when you want to.”
	
“How heartless can you be? They did this, just because I helped you?” I ask in desperation. She takes a few steps down the stairs and turns to me.
	
“I told you, forget. You brought this on yourself.”
	
I clench my jaw, and through gritted teeth say, “so, I should’ve just let you suffer in that alleyway?” She continues walking down the stairs. I keep thinking that she’s going to stop and utter some nonsense statement or say something irrelevantly sarcastic, but no. She keeps going. Out the front door and out of my life.

I don’t move a muscle, not entirely sure I could even if I did choose to. I can only feel myself sobbing, my mind choosing now to replay pointless memories. I hear words being uttered but they’re incomprehensible, just a bunch of gibberish seeping out of my mouth. I hear a thud but still don&#39;t register my body collapsing as I stare on.

	I stand frozen on the staircase, still staring at the door. How one good deed just changed my life, made me question everything I know. But it wasn’t just the past that haunts me, it was also the future. If what she said, and the message they left proved correct, they would be after me. And then there were the cops, I couldn’t just report this to them. What would I even tell the police? What if those that came were in on it too?
	
	I tremble and feel something crawl up my stomach, proving itself to be vomit. I hunch over, trying to catch my breath and get some semblance of sanity back. I can’t stay here. I have to get out of the city. And my best hope of surviving this was to get her help.

	[[I want revenge.]]
	[[I need her for survival.]]
	[[She was a witness, and I need her.]]
	[[She was all I had now.]]
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;
	In both hands are two suitcases, as well as a large duffle bag on his shoulders.
	
	“What did you tell him? To move out?”

	“Of course not,” I growl and approach him, “Uncle, what is this?”

	“It’s everything I need. You sounded urgent, so I packed urgently.” I hear her laugh and throw her a look. That sound coming from her, it was - odd.
	
	She doesn&#39;t look phased by the look and after clearing her throat, straightens up, “Come on, we need to go before they get here. I’m sure they know your car now.” I agree, and once we’re all piled in, I drive us away.

	“So, anyone going to tell me what’s going on?” my uncle asks, his eyes studying the woman in the passenger seat.

Those who did this to my uncle, they’ll do much more than pay. Every fiber within me knew what needed to be done, death would take me before I let them get away. The only way to do that was to get her help, she knew far more than I did, and she had abilities. I feel like I was now seeing the world for what it was, and it was a world that I wouldn’t get far in without her.

It was a decision that I knew I had to make, a decision with little choice. If there were another way, then I would gladly take it. But what choice did I have? I would now be hunted, and the only way out was the way I was taking. Which was more of an in, than an out.

I rush to the room I used to stay in and gather some of my things. I would have to somehow get access to my actual apartment to grab more, but that problem would be there for tomorrow me. I rush down the stairs, pausing when I see a picture of my uncle and me together.

I wouldn’t make it. That was a fact that I knew and wasn’t too prideful to ignore. The first day of learning that supernatural beings exist, and I was suddenly on their hit list. It wasn’t just that, I haven’t even seen one in its true form yet. I watched television and read books like everyone else, but how did one truly kill a supernatural being? Was there any truth to what entertainment sources said?

Going to the police was a foolish notion. They would laugh at me and undoubtedly throw me in the psych ward, either that or put me on the list of potential suspects.

She shakes her head and, making sure to avoid eye contact with me, goes back to observing the area.

“So, you grew up here?” she asks me, a few minutes going by without my uncle appearing. I have an overwhelming need to check on him but refrain, mostly because my companion seems to have gotten more relaxed. If she was relaxed, then danger wasn’t imminent.
	
“Uh, yea. Just me and my uncle.”

I tell him only what he needs to know to be safe and to avoid him asking the unnamed woman any questions. Of course, it does little to sate his curiosities, but his trust in me goes farther than I was led to believe.
			
I go to a three-star hotel and help him check in.
			
“$name, I’m worried about you, what will you do?”
			
“I don’t know. I was thinking about that on the way over here. I think there’s only one thing I can do.” He seems to know what I’m thinking and nods, resting his hand on my shoulder, I can feel it shaking and see his lip quivering.
			
“Please, be safe. I don’t know what else to say. I want to say don’t, but I don’t know. I just don’t know.” I nod in complete understanding, hugging him.
			
“I’ll call whenever I’m situated.” We separate, and he hands the duffel bag to me.
			
“I didn’t know what was going on, but I packed all of the clothes you leave at my place for your never timed right visits. I’m kinda happy I did it now.” I thank him and give him another hug, turning my back to him and walking back outside.

At first, I wasn’t planning on telling him everything. But pieces didn’t make sense without others, and soon I’m telling him everything. No detail was left undiscussed, and a good portion of the ride is spent in silence. Him reflecting and asking brief questions, more towards my unnamed associate than to me.
			
I go to a three-star hotel and help him check in.
			
“Are you sure you’re going to be okay? I’m more than worried. I don’t exactly know what I am,” he trails off, his eyes wandering to his suitcase zipper. He plays with it, avoiding eye contact.
			
“You don’t believe me?”
			
“I don’t know what I believe. You wouldn’t do something so drastic if you were lying, and you have no reason to lie to me. Plus, that story, the details and how you told it ... it’s not that I don’t believe you but that I don’t want to. I woke up this morning thinking about what I was going to have for lunch. I’ll be going to sleep wondering if my boss is a vampire.”
			
“It’ll explain a lot, huh,” I attempt to joke, and he chuckles, relaxing.
			
“I’m worried about you though, what will you do?”
			
“I don’t know. I was thinking about that on the way over here. I think there’s only one thing I can do.” He seems to know what I’m thinking and nods, resting his hand on my shoulder, I can feel it shaking and see his lip quivering.
			
“Please, be safe. I don’t know what else to say. This isn’t my field ... at all. I want to say don’t, but I don’t know. I just don’t know.” I nod in complete understanding, hugging him.
			
“I’ll call whenever I’m situated.” We separate, and he hands the duffel bag to me.
			
“I didn’t know what was going on, but I packed all of the clothes you leave at my place for your never timed right visits. I’m kinda happy I did it now.” I thank him and give him another hug, turning my back to him and walking back outside.

I lie, hoping to persuade him into believing that I was redecorating part of the house as a surprise. He’s suspicious, as any coherent person would be. But seeing that he has no reason not to trust me, accepts my words and promises to give it at least three days before returning.
			
I go to a three-star hotel and help him check in.

“Are you sure you’re going to be okay? You seemed on edge earlier. Not to mention what you told me yesterday, and well,” he trails off, his eyes wandering to the woman who still had no name.
			
“I’ll be fine ... I just need to figure out what I’m going to do.”
			
“$name, talk to me,” he rests a hand on my shoulder and tries to meet my gaze.
			
“I’m fine, Uncle, one of these days you’re going to stop worrying about me,” I say in a joking manner, but he doesn’t crack a smile. He instead hands me the duffel.
			
“These are your clothes, I thought you might want them. I don’t know why.” I thank him and give him another hug, promising to call later on. With that, I turn my back to him and walking back outside.

	I place the duffel bag in the back seat of my car and get in, driving down the street in search of No Name. I find her some ways down the road, walking and using the last bits of sunlight to examine a map.
	
	“Get in,” I tell her as I pull alongside her and get out myself. She ignores me, continuing to gaze down at the map.
	
	“I said get in,” I say, this time a bit harsher than the last.
	
	“Get in and do what, Roe? Huh?”

	“For a girl that acts like she’s not afraid of anything, you sure are afraid.”
	
	“And for a person who acts like they have everything figured out, you sure are stupid. You don’t know what you’re getting yourself into. You do this and you’ll either be coming back a totally different person or dead.”
	
	[[“Which is why you’re coming along.”]]
	[[“Don’t worry about me.”]]
	[[“And if I don’t, I’m still dead.”]]
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	I approach the woman, watching her as she re-situates the bag that she had packed back at the house.
	
	“Well, Roe, it’s been a fun little adventure. Remember what I said and you’ll be fine.” Without even a proper goodbye, she begins to trek away.
	
	“Wait, that’s it?” I shout after her, and she stops, turning to me with genuine confusion.
	
	“Yea. Your uncle’s safe and you’re still kicking. No death can be blamed on me, so I’m going to disappear. I have shit to handle.”
	
	“Do you do this a lot? Pop into people’s lives, tell them that the supernatural world is real, and then disappear. I mean, I don’t even know your name.”
	
	“That’s a good thing, knowing my name brings up a whole lot more problems than you think.” I stare after her, trying to come to grips with everything that has taken place. How such a little thing, just saving someone and trying to be a good person, has led me here.
	
	“Answer this for me,” I yell after her, “am I safe? Or will they continue to come after me?” The time between driving my uncle here and then now, I’ve been trying to come up with alternative plans. But I know I won’t survive without her help. Every alternative plan proved irrelevant, the only one that didn’t, was the one I was standing on now.
	
	“They’ll continue,” I hear her say.
	
	[[“So, if I die, my death can be blamed on you?”]]
	[[“Let’s team up then.”]]
	[[“Either you bring me, or I’ll make your life hell.”]]

“Let me get this straight. You find your uncle dead and think you can just take on anything?”
	
“I don’t have anything to lose.”
	
“You’re going to end up rethinking that.” She bites the side of her cheek and then gazes up at the sky as if asking it what it thought. “If you’re going to do this then you listen to what I say, got it?”
	
“Fine, whatever. All this coming from a girl who’s afraid to tell me her name.”

&lt;&lt;if $uncledead&gt;&gt;\
	“Where to then, Sydero?”
	
	“Your uncle’s house.”
	
	“Why?”
	
	“You’ll see.” I don’t question her, turning the car around and heading back to the place that holds memories both good and bad. The two of us sit quietly, looking at the house as if we were old friends, afraid to approach whoever resided inside.
	
	She finally speaks, “your uncle’s body. We need to get rid of it unless you want the police putting you at the top of their list for suspects of murder.”
	
	“Doesn’t getting rid of it make me seem even more likely?”
	
	“That’s why I think you should make it look like an accident. I have a spell that can work, but it requires a house fire.”
	
	“You seem too calm about all this; how many times have you done this?”
	
	“This exact thing? Not much. Make a kill look like an accident? Tons of times. The question is: do you want to do this, or shall I?” I look at the house that I grew up in. I imagine all the times where my uncle would play with me in his yard, the times we would have water balloon wars or snowball fights. The images disappear and are replaced by the look on his face as he died. All that remains are questions about how quick his death was and what was going through his mind during it.
	
	I understood why this needed to be done. I had to go off the grid. If the house stands and I disappeared with the body still inside, I was more than a suspect. Regardless of what was inside and whatever I said. Those after me, along with the police, would at least pause at this. It’ll buy us needed time.
	
	[[“I’ll help.”]]
	[[“You can do it.”]]
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	She taps the side of her cheek, murmuring some words to herself. The best that I can guess is that she’s weighing her options. At one point, her eyes meet mine and refuse to look away. She studies me with such intensity that I feel like I’m under a microscope.
	
	She walks back over to me, stopping once she gets to the other side of the car, “you join me, and your entire life is going to change, and you’re going to have to change with it.”
	
	“Done.”
	
	“Aren’t you in college, you’ll just throw that away?”
	
	“It&#39;s finals, and besides having to turn an essay in, I’m done. I could use a little break next fall anyway.”
	
	“You’re going to have people and things hunting you.”
	
	“Okay, too late.”
	
	“Everyone you know, you no longer know. Unless you want to see them dead.” I nod in understanding.
	
	“You say all of this now, but as soon as it happens, you’re going to be thinking differently.”
	
	“Let me worry about my existential crisis.” She takes a deep breath and cocks her head to the side, studying me once again. Finally, she offers me her hand, and I shake it.
	
	“Name’s Sydero.” Sydero, I test the name again and again, all without saying it. I nod and let go of her hand, and she takes a step back. She sets her bag in the back seat and then gets in. She grabs my phone and gives me the location to drive towards, and I do so.

	The fire spreads, quickly eating everything in its path. I watch it for a time, watching as it not only consumes my memories, but also the truth.
	
	Sydero comes out later, turning to survey the house before getting into the car. She doesn’t have to tell me to drive, as soon as she closes the door I’m doing so. I don’t know where to until she asks for my phone and puts the address in. It was outside of the city, not far but far enough that all of this will continue to feel real.
	
	[[Continue-&gt;In an unknown location ...]]
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;
	The ride is awkwardly quiet. //Sydero// is looking out the window while I replay the last two days in my head. Supernatural creatures were real. I was being hunted. My uncle is safe, but I was now driving around with a witch. I went from having a semi-normal life to this. I keep telling myself that the path I was taking was foolish, that there was another way. But after exploring my own thoughts, I keep coming to the same understanding.
	
	There wasn’t.
	
	[[I wanted revenge.]]
	[[I needed her for survival.]]
	[[She was all that I had now.]]

&lt;&lt;set $motive = &quot;revenge&quot;&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
I wasn’t the type to take this kind of treatment without fighting back. Every fiber within me knew what needed to be done, either I would die, or they would. The only way to do that was to get her help, Sydero knew far more than I did, and she had abilities. I feel like I see the world for what it is, and it’s a world that I wouldn’t get far in without her.

I grip the steering wheel tighter, trying to clear up my mind even partially as we ride down the street towards the address that she had given me. Numerous questions were still not answered, but they would have to wait until later. Wherever we were headed, I just hope there was a bed.

&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
I wouldn’t make it. That was a fact that I knew and wasn’t too prideful to ignore. The first day of learning that supernatural beings exist, and I was suddenly on their hit list. It wasn’t just that, I haven’t even seen one in its true form yet. I watched television and read books like everyone else, but how did one kill a supernatural being? Was there any truth to what entertainment sources said?

Whether I want to accept it or not, in this new world she was all I had. There was Chris, and my uncle of course, but dragging them into this would do more damage than anything else. Chris’s reaction would be similar to mine if not worse, and he hadn’t heard what I heard, seen what I’ve seen. But her, she was a direct link, she knew what I was going through, and she knew about this world. She wouldn’t look at me crazy.

I can’t see what she’s doing, but after a while, I see bright flames light up the living room and kitchen. I gaze out at the closest house, there was enough distance between the homes to where it shouldn’t become an out of control fire. But I can only hope this would destroy just my uncle’s house, and that’s it.

&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
Sydero leaves to do whatever else the spell needs, just my uncle’s mutilated body and I, remain. I open my mouth to speak, to say something, anything. Whether this was for my peace of mind or for him, I don’t know. I can’t even form words. I shake my head and stand, leaving the house. I wipe my tears away, hoping that he was with his wife and child now.

&lt;&lt;set $sympathy -=3&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
I shake my head, giving Sydero the go-ahead to do whatever is needed. I leave the house and help her with anything else she needs, which isn’t much. She had three pieces of paper, and once she starts the grease fire, she carefully places one in. I notice that with each sheet, the fire grows, consuming more until I’m forced to leave the house.

&#39;&#39;In a unknown location ...&#39;&#39;

A nightmarish scream rings out, echoing off the filthy stone to ears who knew well enough the pain that the individual was experiencing. Their torturous cries rang out just the same. They begged their harasser for mercy, at the same time knowing that such a luxury would never be given.

A handful of cold dark eyes whose depths held no end, stared on at one of these screaming figures. The figure begged them for a second chance, begged them for mercy, anything but what was to come of its failure. None of them moved as the burning white whip struck oily skin again, pieces slipping off and adding to the mess along the filth ridden floor.

“It&#39;s not my fault,” it screams. An unwise thing to say, as it would be the last words that the figure ever uttered. One last strike and the figure&#39;s pain was put to an end, the spirit&#39;s body collapsing against the ground and the only wails were from those further in the prison.

“Well then,” a single commanding voice begins calmly, gazing at the mess, “clean this up before it begins rotting.” They all surged forward, and he went back to the entryway to stand beside another figure whose eyes sparkled with a golden spark.

“How do you feel about your new job?” he asked the golden-eyed figure curiously.

“It doesn’t really matter how I feel about it, now does it?” he laughs, “Master should’ve never sent his lowest creatures for a job like this.”

“He’s always sent his lowest creatures, this should’ve never happened,” the calmer figure replies.

“Yes, and now I must clean it up.”

“You must find $name Roe first,” the figure laughs, slapping the slouching shoulder of his compatriot. He leans in slowly and whispers, “good luck. You know what will happen if you fail.” Both of their eyes fall to the mess that was slowly being cleaned by others. The spirit with the golden eyes narrowed his gaze. Indeed, he did know.

[[Next Time on Superstition-&gt;EP1NT]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="291" name="A1_4" tags="" position="2732,1103" size="100,100">“Hey!” a worker from the store barks, a shotgun resting in her hands, “unless you have further official business, I suggest you get on out of here.” She announces this to all of us, but her eyes never leave mine, and her body language seems to only acknowledge me. I raise my hands in defense, relieved to see the three men backing off now.

I make eye contact with no one, rapidly putting the groceries inside the car and then driving off. I retrace my steps back to the abandoned house, making sure no one is following me. When did this become the norm for me? The feeling that I was never safe and must always check my rearview mirror for those trailing me?

I take a moment to compose myself when I feel the familiar sensation of a vibrating phone. My heart thumps wildly as only one face appears in my mind. I grab it to see my thoughts proven correct, a goofy photo of Chris stares back at me. My stomach twists and knots up immediately. The feeling of a hundred tiny needles pricking my inner stomach harshly. 

He was my best friend; his hair was probably turning grey from worrying about me. But at the same time, I wasn’t supposed to talk to anyone. It continues to ring; it would be sent to voicemail soon.

[[Pick up the phone.]]

&lt;&lt;set $chriscall = true&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
I gaze over at the house before accepting the call.
		
“Hello?”

&lt;&lt;if $uncledead&gt;&gt;\
	&quot;Hello? That&#39;s all you have to say after I left you about ten thousand messages?! What&#39;s wrong with you? Where the hell are you? What happened? Your uncle&#39;s house, and your uncle ... and ... I&#39;m so sorry. Where are you?”
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“Hello? That’s all you have to say after I left you about ten thousand messages. What’s wrong with you? Where the hell are you? What happened? Those cops showed up with a warrant for you. And guess who they questioned, me!”
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“I ... I can’t tell you, Chris.”

“What, is this some secret government stuff? What do you mean you can’t tell me?”
		
“It’s a long story that you won’t believe, I’m still trying to believe it. But I’m okay.”
		
&lt;&lt;if $uncledead&gt;&gt;\
	“So, you vanish after your uncle’s house burns down and your uncle dies, and you’re telling me you can’t tell me? If the cops didn’t believe you were a victim, you would definitely be a suspect. Tell me what’s going on. I want to help you or at least get closure for myself.”
	
	“Closure for what?”
	
	“Knowing that my best friend didn’t have some part in burning down $his uncle’s house!”
	
	“Don’t do that, how could that even come out of your mouth?”
	
	“I don’t know what to believe unless you tell me.” I look back towards the house, rehearsing the words in my head. Each time I repeat a sentence though, I find it just as crazy as the first time. There was no way Chris would understand what I was trying to convey to him this way. If he was going to believe me, he needed to see me, face to face.

&lt;&lt;set $chris -5&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
I flip the phone over so that I can’t see his picture anymore and take a deep breath. I did the right thing, that much I know. If I had talked to Chris, who knows what might happen?
		
My life was more than an unpredictable mess at the moment, it was better to not include others. Also, who was to say that he would believe me? I only believed it because I was living it and if it wasn’t for Sydero, then I might still be doubting. No, it was better this way.

“No. Do you know a town called Foster? Small town in the middle of nowhere?”
				
“Yea, during tennis matches we stop at the grocery store there.”
				
“Great, meet me at that grocery store. I’ll tell you everything when I see you, okay? Around 3?”
				
“Fine, be safe, alright?”
				
“You too. And Chris, if you can, can you stop by my apartment and grab my laptop and some clothes?” I ask. I hear him mumble underneath his breath but in the end, he agrees to do what I’ve asked.
				
“And no one can know about this Chris,” I state, stressing every syllable.
				
“Yea, because I was going to scream this little meeting to the heavens.” A second later he hangs up the phone, and I once again sit in silence. I rest my hand on the seat’s headrest. Again, the question of how I got myself into this mess arises, and how I would get out.

&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
“No $name wait,” he starts, but I hang up the phone before he can change my mind. I rest the phone beside me and take a deep breath. I did the right thing, that much I know. If I had invited Chris, who knows what might happen?

My life was more than an unpredictable mess at the moment, it was better to not include others. Also, who was to say that he would believe me? I only believed it because I was living it and if it wasn’t for Sydero, then I might still be doubting. No, it was better this way.

[[Continue-&gt;A1_5]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="296" name="A1_5" tags="" position="2953,1105" size="100,100">I grab the groceries and hurry inside, placing them on the table. A moment later, Sydero peeks her head out of the room she&#39;s in, walking out with two books in her hand.

“You got the stuff?”

&lt;&lt;if $syderolist&gt;&gt;\
	“Of course.” I remove the things she asked for, placing them on the edge for her to collect.
	
	“Thank you.” I raise a brow at her words, though I don&#39;t comment. It wasn&#39;t hard to guess that such words rarely came out of her mouth.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“No, um, they didn’t have what you needed.” She raises a disbelieving brow, leaning forward on the unstable wooden railing. The wood groans underneath her weight, at any moment looking ready to snap.
	
	“They didn’t have salt.”
	
	“Nope,” I reply with the straightest face I can muster. She doesn’t seem to believe me, but she lets the argument go.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“These are for you.” Before I can question her, she walks down the stairs and drops the two books off. She separates them and turns each to face me. One of the books is beyond weathered and its text hardly recognizable. Just barely can I make out the words ‘The Lore.’ The other is a dark sable grey with a strange crimson icon. I flip the book open to see the words ‘Book of the Damned.’

“Uh, is that satanic?” I question, and she rolls her eyes. Her expression says that my question was ridiculous, but I fail to see why based off of what I had just read.

She points to //The Lore//, “this book is a great reference and covers almost all the supernatural creatures out there, again //almost//. Want to know the difference between a true werewolf and a werewolf hybrid? This is your book.” She moves her hand to cover the other. “This one deals with legends and stories. Do werewolves really howl at the moon? No. This book goes into where that myth came from. Think of this book as the supernatural myth buster.”

&quot;Also, here,&quot; she reaches into her back pocket and delicately pulls out a shimmering silver blade. It was small but deathly sharp. The way she handles it is with finesse, someone who has handled and became familiar with such an item.

&quot;What do I need this for?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll learn that most supernatural creatures are hurt by silver. I&#39;ll teach you how to use it later but it&#39;s always good to have it on your person.&quot; I accept it, running my fingers over the cold stainless metal. In a dangerous way, the blade was beautiful. Before I can admire it further, Sydero clears her throat and pushes the two books closer to me.

“You want me to read both of these?”

&lt;&lt;if $syderolist&gt;&gt;\
	“Do what you want with these, I don’t really care. Now, if you’ll excuse me,” she begins and grabs the items she asked for, “I’ll be working on these spells.”
	
	“Need any help?” She doesn’t answer; instead, she chuckles sarcastically as she goes.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“Do what you want with these, I don’t really care. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to have to improvise because someone wanted to be childish.” She pauses, turning to me as she places her hand out.
	
	“What?”
	
	“I gave you money for that trip, I want it back, obviously.” I dig into my pocket and retrieve the bills.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

I hear the door close behind her, signaling that I was once again on my own in some unknown house that I knew nothing of. I spy the books sitting idle and think about the other things that I could possibly do.

[[Read one of the books.]]
[[Spend time working out.]]
[[Get my thoughts together.]]
[[Bug Sydero in an attempt to get to know her.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="297" name="A2" tags="" position="3407,1102" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;if $uncledead&gt;&gt;
	After I finish, I lie down on the bed, staring up at the ceiling. Flashes of my uncle arise, as well as of his burning house. I know that everyone deals with loss differently. That some hardly shed a tear, a whimper, for those that have moved on. Others grieve for months, failing to see even the dimmest of lights. But they all yearn for the same flicker of hope, only a few grasp it.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;
	After I finish, I lie down on the bed, staring up at the ceiling. I feel like a terrible migraine was moving in. Placing itself between my disbelief and fear. A good night’s sleep could cure it, maybe. But who knows when I’ll get another one of those.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

My eyes drift closed. I fight nothing. Even the uncomfortable bed doesn’t deter me.

“$name!” I jump up, looking around in shock. Had I seriously fallen asleep? I look up to see Sydero standing under the arch, a bottle of discolored liquid residing in her hands.

“This can work one of three ways, you drink this, you dunk it on yourself, or I throw it on you.”

“Why would I ever pick the last one?”

“Trust me, that’s probably the best option.”

[[Ask what’s in it.]]
[[Drink it.]]
[[Do it myself.]]
[[Let her throw it on me.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="298" name="Read one of the books." tags="" position="2915,1321" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;set $ss_supernatural = true&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;set $supernatural +=5&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
I grab the books that Sydero had dropped off, walking into the room and sitting on the edge of the bed. I open both of them, trying to decide which one to look at first.
		
The Lore’s table of contents was quite simple. Like Sydero said, it highlighted the species and even went into sub-species and other things that needed to be discussed.
		
The Book of the Damned was more focused on legends and events. It looks to contain real events and myths, as well as discuss specific people. It makes sense why Sydero believed I would need to know about both.

&lt;&lt;set $athleticism +=5&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
I move the table to the side and lay a towel down on the ground. I would have to find a laundromat sometime soon, there was no way I was putting this towel anywhere near my other stuff. In fact, I had half a mind to just throw it away after this.
		
With the towel down, I start my workout. I do the basic things like pushups, crunches, and some other core and arm exercises. If I knew the neighborhood, and didn’t fear a werewolf jumping out of the bushes, I’d probably go for a run as well.
		
Thankfully, the workout does what I intended it to do. Give me a distraction, get my blood pumping, and put if only the tiniest semblance of normality back into my life. But I know that this feeling won’t stick around for long.

&lt;&lt;set $nerve +=5&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
I take a deep breath and gather my thoughts. This was the best way to work things out in my mind. It was either this or walking around with my nightmares banging into one another, getting me nowhere but closer to depression.
		
I constantly remind myself that I can’t change anything, it was now the past whether I like it or not. I need to be careful, everything I did needed to be thought out. Sydero doesn’t seem to want to do me harm, but even I know she’s hiding multiple things. Either I have yet to ask the right questions, or she has no intention of answering them all. I would need to watch those who I was around, perhaps even more than those after me.

This action would either hurt my already delicate relationship with her or strengthen it, if only just a bit. And that was all I was hoping for, to get a better a grasp of the person I was now traveling with.

I walk up the stairs and to her door, knocking on it multiple times when I receive no answer. She opens it on the fourth knock, her brow raised and her patience appearing low.
		
“Hey Sydero, how are you?”
		
“Seriously? What do you want?”
		
“This is actually an attempt to get to know you better.” 
		
She leans on the frame of the doorway, “huh, and how do you plan on doing that? Bugging me until I answer something?”

[[“We could ask each other ten random questions or something.”]]
[[“If we’re going to be traveling together, then we should at least know each other.”]]

&lt;&lt;set $supernatural +5&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
I flip through the table of contents nonchalantly until I finally persuade myself to go to a specific page, the werewolf one.
				
On the left side of the book are charts and diagrams discussing werewolves. Some show the phases they go through while another labels what happens at each phase of the moon, and even another discusses their weak spots.
				
The other side of the page is filled with words and more words. I skim most of it due to the small writing. But some of the text grabs my attention. It points out important facts like a werewolf’s appearance, and how freshly turned werewolves that haven’t transformed are known as weanlings. I learn that werewolves eat the hearts of their victims, especially liking the taste of virgin hearts, those being able to sustain them longer. Their vulnerabilities were silver and their own hearts.

As I browse, my eyes land on a weird picture of men and women in costumes, all roaming through a forest and towards a pit of darkness. I begin to read, learning that this was all part of a Celtic festival named Samhain. In other words, I read, it is where Halloween originally originated from. It was thought that on the day of Halloween, dead spirits were able to rise and walk the Earth once more. The Celts would dress up in costumes to ward off these ghosts.
				
From there, other cultures chose what they wanted and threw their own twist on it, Halloween taking on different meanings and symbolizing different things in individual cultures.

“Then we go with Plan B or C, or even D. Are we done here, great.” She closes the door without a second thought.

“Because it is.” I sigh, unscrewing the top and splashing some on me like it was some sort of fragrance. My nose twitches as I catch a whiff of a disagreeable smell. It starts off faint before escalating tremendously, causing me to shudder violently.

I gaze over at her, “what are you doing now?” 

“A tracking spell.”

“To find the people after us?”

“Yea.”

“I want to help.”

“No.”

“Why not?”

“Because this isn’t something that you can help with. Spells like this can only be done by a witch. So, leave a witch to it. And I swear, if you disturb me, I’ll give you a straight dose of skunk urine.”

&lt;&lt;if $chrismeeting&gt;&gt;\
	I drive back to the grocery store, relieved when I see no signs of the men from earlier. I’m not entirely sure what I would do if they were to appear again. Instead of parking right next to the store, I take a more discrete parking spot. This spot was closer to a patch of trees, as well as by a large dumpster. 
	
	I cut the engine, rehearsing what I would say to Chris. Nothing I say causes me to nod and feel even a slight bit better about my predicament. I realize that I was just now exposed to the truth of the world, but I saw it with my own eyes. I was living it. Chris was not, how would I get him to believe me?
	
	Thirty minutes or so later, I hear the familiar sound of loud classic rock and look to see Chris’s car. I honk my horn, guiding him to my location. As soon as I get out, Chris is upon me, wrapping me in a big hug. 
	
	“Whoa!” he shouts, releasing me and taking a few steps back, “what the heck is that? Is that you smelling like that?” I chuckle softly, almost forgetting about the cleansing that Sydero had me undergo.
	
	“It’s part of the story.”

	“Then you should start telling it before I pass out.”

	“Chris, I doubt – no I know, that you’re not going to believe a word that comes out of my mouth.”

	&lt;&lt;if $uncledead&gt;&gt;\
		“I just drove about an hour to meet up with you. I came for answers, not excuses. Folks are worried about you, $name. You disappear out of nowhere, and coincidentally it’s right when your uncle’s house burns down, and authorities find out that he’s dead? If I had to fight everyone who believed you were a murderer or an arsonist, then I’d be rivaling Mayweather in wins.”
	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
		“I just drove about an hour to meet up with you. I came for answers, not excuses. Folks are worried about you, $name. You disappear out of nowhere, and everyone knows about the cops wanting to arrest you. And then, your uncle is gone, and no one knows where. If I had to fight everyone who believed you were a murderer or involved in some government conspiracy, then I’d be rivaling Mayweather in wins.”
	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

	“Oh, so you would win all of them?” I question and Chris chuckles.
	
	“Well, not to toot my own horn but,” he states and toots an invisible horn, smiling warmly at me. I smile in turn but feel it slowly fall. Whether or not Chris would believe me, he was untainted. Like Sydero said, most people couldn’t handle the truth, and so they were allowed to live in their oblivious existence, never learning what crept in the dark. People were already haunted by their own demons, it would do them no good to know that werewolves and vampires needed to be added to that list as well.

	He would either believe me, think me crazy, or think me mad and believe the rumors. At this exact moment, the Chris standing before me was my best friend. The brilliant and fun-loving man that sat beside me in freshman seminar, whispering to me that I didn’t have to raise my hand to use the bathroom. When I look into those soft bluish-grey eyes, I know he sees the same friend. Did I truly wish to see that look vanish forever?

	[[Send him back home.]]
	[[Tell Chris the truth.]]
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	I grumble as I make my way back towards my room, freezing when I catch a glimpse outside. It wasn&#39;t so much what I did see, as it was what I didn&#39;t. I dash to the window and look up and down the street. My car was nowhere to be seen.
	
	&quot;Crap,&quot; I say under my breath, my mind racing when it comes to a screeching halt. The three guys from earlier, but would they have seriously taken my car? I dash into my room, finding my keys still where I left them. If they did take my car, then they either brought a tow truck or broke into it. The mental image of them busting one of my windows open and hotwiring my vehicle sends anger coursing through me.
	
	&quot;Sydero,&quot; I shout, marching back upstairs with purpose.
	
	&quot;What?&quot; she growls, dragging out the word.
	
	&quot;We have a problem,&quot; I grab her wrist, knowing she wouldn&#39;t listen to me any other way. She doesn&#39;t struggle, but she does constantly question what the problem could be, as well as stating that the only problem she can see was me. I stop at the window and point outside.
	
	&quot;Tell me what&#39;s missing.&quot; It doesn&#39;t take long for her to catch on, and when she does realize the issue at hand, she turns to me.
	
	&quot;I&#39;m guessing you have some idea about who did it?&quot;
	
	&quot;Yea, three guys that I think are actually supernaturals.&quot;
	
	&quot;What do you mean?&quot;
	
	&quot;They had werewolf tendencies I guess I&#39;d say.&quot; She laughs at this, patting my shoulder like I was a helpless, naive child. I follow her outside, both of us scouring the streets for any sign. 
	
	&quot;It&#39;s a small town, not a lot of places to hide a vehicle like yours. We&#39;ll search by the general store first, and work our way from there.&quot; I nod, going inside to grab my wallet and keys, it would be easier to find if I could hear my car going off. As soon as I&#39;m ready, we set off towards the store on foot.
		
	Once there, we decide to split up and meet back in front of the general store.

“I’m not leaving until I hear what happened.”

“Chris, go home,” I say and turn to grip my car’s door handle.

“No. Tell me what’s going on, $name,” he growls and grabs my shoulders, turning me around and giving them a light squeeze.

“It’s not what you think,” I start, not knowing exactly where to begin. I had rehearsed this. And though I wasn’t happy with any of the previous tries, I should at least be prepared for how to begin the explanation.

He and his group killed my uncle to send me a message for helping the woman and interfering, the message saying I was next.

	Chris stares at me long and hard, giving no evidence of what he’s thinking.

“I’m sorry. I didn’t know we were being serious.” I physically and emotionally deflate at his reaction, beginning to rethink all of this.
			
“I told you you wouldn’t believe me.” He laughs again, this time having to lean on my car to remain standing.

“I have one question, what college student gave you these drugs you’re rocked out on?” I remain quiet, it was obvious that he wasn’t going to believe me. “No, but seriously, give me his info cos I want some. I could make a fortune on em during finals.”
			
“Everything I just told you is the truth.”
			
“Do you hear yourself?”
			
“I do, and it took me a while to believe it too, but if you’ve seen what I have in the last twenty-four hours alone ... you would believe it all too.”

	&quot;Wait, is this the girl you told me about before you left, back in the library?&quot;
	
	&quot;Yea, this is her.&quot; He sighs deeply, covering his face with his hand before looking at me.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“You got any proof of this? Like a dead werewolf in the trunk?” he asks.
			
	“I can find some proof.”
			
	“$name,” he starts, but I stop him with a raised hand, waving his doubts and words away.

“This is something you wouldn’t understand, Chris. I barely understand it.”
					
“So that’s it? That’s how you’re going to leave this?” I nod slowly. He backs away from me, a new look in his eye. This look is bewildered, not sure of what it’s looking at. It would seem that whether I told him or not, he would leave today not seeing me the same way.
					
He opens the passenger side of his car, passing me a large suitcase.
					
“Here’s the stuff you asked for,” he mumbles. He gives me no time to thank him, as he gets into his car and reverses. Right before he drives off, he rolls down the window.
					
“Goodbye, $name.” I watch the car disappear, along with my best friend.

&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“How was the trip?” So, she knows that I left. Of course she knows. All she had to do was walk out and see that I wasn’t there, or she probably guessed when I didn’t come by and tap on the door.
	
“Uh, good. How’s the tracking spell going?” She disappears but comes back into the foyer with a water bottle in hand.
	
“It’s going fine, had to look around for some more ingredients.” She lets out a loud yawn, shaking her head and taking a long gulp of the water. Neither of us says anything to the other, and after she takes another gulp, she heads back towards the staircase.

	“No.”
		
	“Come on, Sydero, I had to. He’s down here and doesn’t know where we are, I didn’t tell him that. But he doesn’t believe me, can’t blame him. But he wants proof, and you’re the only thing I could think of.”
		
	“Ah, so you want me to meet him, tell him that you’re telling the truth. Maybe show him a spell or two?”
		
	“Yes! That would be great!”
		
	“No.”
	
	“But –”
		
	“No. I warned you, and you, again, did the opposite. And like all the other times, you can face the consequences on your own.” She goes into the room and slams the door, ignoring me as I bang up against it. I would either need to figure out something else or give her some time, persuade her further. I was currently at a loss on how. I just know I needed to.

“For what? To pay someone to act along with you?”
					
“You know me better than that,” I stress, “you should at least let me try and show you.

Finally, he stops, shaking his head and groaning loudly.

“I’m going to get a room at the only motel in this town. I’m giving you till tomorrow.”
					
“Here’s the stuff you asked for,” he mumbles, opening his passenger door and handing over a large suitcase. He gives me no time to thank him, as he gets into his car and reverses.

“$name, don’t do this,” he tells me, hurrying to his car. I waste no time, pulling out of the parking lot and speeding away. As I drive, I regularly check to see if he’s behind me. Once I know for sure that he’s not following, I head back to the abandoned house. I was becoming far too accustomed to losing people in this car.

There was no way he was going to believe me, no way whatsoever. And then, for him to take it all as a joke. This was a mistake. I wasn’t getting anywhere, and now he would probably think I was lying to cover up something else.
					
“Whatever, I give up,” I finally say, and throw my hands in the air.
					
“Can you blame me for not believing you?” Chris asks, no longer playful or smiling.
					
“No, I can’t, because I know how crazy this all sounds. But I told you, and that’s all I can do. What you do with that, none of my business.”
					
“So, what now?” he asks me, but the way he says it, it seems like he had an idea about what should happen next. I raise an inquisitive brow and look at him.
					
“$name, you need to turn yourself into the police. Come clean.”
					
“About how I’m innocent?”
				
“I don’t know if you’re innocent. I’d like to believe it, but I guess we’ll see.” Would he call the cops on me if I refused or did he bring them with him? No, they would’ve shown themselves by now.

“I’m sorry this is how it went,” I tell him, walking to my car and getting in.

I continue walking around, failing to find or hear my car. The idea could&#39;ve worked if my car was anywhere nearby.

I meet back up with Sydero, exchanging information. She was told that the car was being towed and headed towards Shawn&#39;s Junkyard. We waste no time and head over. Hopefully, next time we come through here would be in a car, my car.
	
Shawn&#39;s Junkyard was your standard run-of-the-mill trash pile. Only a poorly painted sign lets us know where we are. Out of commission cars rest atop the light tan dirt ground, each one reminding me of a puzzle to a jigsaw with how they were arranged. Finding my car in this graveyard would be easy, as long as it still resembles my car. My hopes that they haven&#39;t done something to it begins to disappear, but one nudge from Sydero renews it immediately. I follow her finger and see my car near a building, the three men that had taken it a few yards away, laughing at something.

&quot;What kind of supernaturals are they?&quot; I question. I don&#39;t know how Sydero can tell, perhaps a spell or maybe even a fundamental understanding since she&#39;s been around them so long.
	
&quot;They&#39;re not supernaturals,&quot; she tells me plainly, &quot;they&#39;re just humans.&quot;
	
&quot;What!&quot; I exclaim. She motions for me to follow quietly, both of us attempting to get closer, using the cars to hide us.

Two old men sit out in front, each with a newspaper cradled in their hands. They stare into the distance, even with me approaching their gaze doesn&#39;t waver. This was probably a daily thing for them, for all I know they&#39;re asleep. I approach and clear my throat, neither man budges.
			
&quot;Excuse me,&quot; I try, again to no avail.
			
&quot;They&#39;re asleep,&quot; a voice states and I look up to see a pretty young blonde haired girl looking at me. In her hands is a dish towel and she wears a cliche plaid diner uniform.
			
&quot;Ah, had a feeling they were,&quot; I smirk playfully.
			
&quot;Can I help you with something?&quot; She seems low on patience, but still, her eyes give away her curiosity.

&quot;If the shoe fits, then I guess so,&quot; I huff.
					
The woman doesn&#39;t look offended or shocked; instead, she seems almost happy with my words. She reaches down and sits her shotgun on top of the belt, cocking her head to the side.
					
&quot;I suggest you go now.&quot; As far as I&#39;ve seen, everyone in this town was either crazy or close enough. Testing her wasn&#39;t wise, and I refuse to die in some backwater town because a clerk was easily offended.

I meet back up with Sydero, exchanging information. She was told that the car was being towed and headed towards Shawn&#39;s Junkyard. We waste no time and head over. Hopefully, next time we come through here would be in a car, my car.
	
Shawn&#39;s Junkyard was your standard run-of-the-mill trash pile. Only a poorly painted sign lets us know where we are. Out of commission cars rest atop the light tan dirt ground, each one reminding me of a puzzle to a jigsaw with how they were arranged. Finding my car in this graveyard would be easy, as long as it still resembles my car. My hopes that they haven&#39;t done something to it begin to disappear, but one nudge from Sydero renews it immediately. I follow her finger and see my car near a building, the three men that had taken it a few yards away, laughing at something.

&quot;What kind of supernaturals are they?&quot; I question. I don&#39;t know how Sydero can tell, perhaps a spell or maybe even a fundamental understanding since she&#39;s been around them so long.
	
&quot;They&#39;re not supernaturals,&quot; she tells me plainly, &quot;they&#39;re just humans.&quot;
	
&quot;What!&quot; I exclaim. She motions for me to follow quietly, both of us attempting to get closer, using the cars to hide us.

&quot;There&#39;s a lot of terminology involved, you&#39;ll learn it as you go. Basically, it&#39;s anyone who hunts monsters. You have humans who hunt whether because they were born in it or saw something and decided to get in on it, they&#39;re called hunters.&quot;
			
&quot;I&#39;m guessing others have a different name?&quot;
			
&quot;Humans are hunters, but folks like me - supernatural beings who hunt - are called specialists. Look we can talk about this later, right now we need to get your car back.&quot; I nod in agreement.
			
&quot;Got a plan?&quot; I ask her.

&quot;I do. We can clone your car. The spell would be focus and distance based, so the car won&#39;t disappear until we&#39;re out of here.&quot;
	
&quot;You can do that? Clone things?&quot;
	
&quot;Yea, witchcraft is pretty powerful.&quot;

&quot;I actually don&#39;t think you did. You look like you&#39;re hardworking, the type of girl who doesn&#39;t slack off. Let me guess, lead waitress?&quot; I don&#39;t even know if that is a thing, but the smile that she sends me at least says I&#39;m saying the right things.
					
&quot;That&#39;s why I came over here, I thought these nice gentlemen might have seen it.&quot;
					
&quot;Yea, this is kinda a thing for them. I did happen to see your car though, kinda flashy looking?&quot; Compared to what she was used to seeing around her, any car made in the last five years would be flashy. I nod, to avoid saying anything that would get her off my side.
					
&quot;I saw it being towed, heading towards Shawn&#39;s Junkyard.&quot; How I manage to keep a straight face illudes me, because Inside Me was throwing the temper tantrum of the year. I thank her and turn on my heel, my eye twitching as I think about what could be happening to my car right now.

I wait until Sydero has appropriately gotten their attention, stating that she was sent there to pick up something. If the three men tried to overtake her, I had no doubt that she could fight them off, especially since they were just humans.
			
I make it to the car and open the glove department, grabbing a random piece of useless paper. I move back to our hiding place, waiting for her to walk off and then once they stop watching her, bring her to where I&#39;m hiding.
			
She mumbles some words to the paper and nods, the two of us going back to my car.
			
&quot;Won&#39;t they hear us when I start the engine and drive off?&quot;
			
&quot;No,&quot; she states, &quot;the spell I put over them is going to wear off soon, but it&#39;s a mirage one. It&#39;s like they&#39;re in their own little bubble right now.

I do the simplest thing I can think of, sneak over. As long as I use the cars for cover, I should be fine. Sydero stays where she is, mumbling something that I can&#39;t hear while she focuses on the men. I surmise that she&#39;s in the middle of some kind of spell or curse and I continue on. 
			
Whether under her influence or just because I was quiet, I&#39;m able to make it to the car undetected. I grab a random piece of worthless paper from the glove department and dart back to Sydero&#39;s side.

&#39;&#39;In Sydero&#39;s room ...&#39;&#39;

Sydero pauses, her back leaning heavily against the door. She presses an ear to it, curious if Roe would actually attempt this rescue mission without her. $He learns that supernatural creatures exist and suddenly thinks $he can take one on. And not just one, multiple ones. If $he failed to listen to her, then there was little she could do. She wasn’t a babysitter. 

Regardless of her stubborn thoughts, the sound of a door slamming and that of a distant engine opens up a pit in her stomach. She should be ecstatic. In no way related to her, she was able to get rid of Roe. There was no way Roe would survive whatever was lying in wait for $him. In fact, $his actions will give her a large opening of escape.

Sydero sneers as she rushes to pack her things, stuffing everything she could into her pack. She doubts she’ll be back to this safehouse, so taking what was left would be beneficial. Suddenly she became woozy, her quick actions ceasing as she sat back on her feet. This was a feeling she was slowly growing more accustomed to each day. Every time she used her power, it got worse. And her current thoughts weren’t helping either.

&lt;&lt;if $SRomance &gt;= 1&gt;&gt;\
	She wanted to believe that abandoning Roe was the right thing to do, for her anyway. She couldn’t think of too many positives to saving $him. So why was her brain working tirelessly to figure out a way to save the day? To make sure that Roe was okay? She was not a fan of lying to herself, but here she was trying to suggest that she wouldn’t feel Roe’s absence. 
	
	Somehow, that stubborn person managed to worm themselves straight into her life. She hated $him for it. Hated that she would poke her head out to see if she could get a glimpse of $him, or having her gaze linger on $him for too long. She even found herself missing the constant, yet annoying, inquisitive voice of $his.

&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“Fuck!” she shouts in anger. If she were born a dragon, then smoke would be pouring out of her nose, filling the room up with its toxic fumes. She stuffs the last essentials into her bag, recalling that Roe said something about a motel. She was never a fan of plans and has never seen the benefit in them. She’ll just improvise, like always.

I slam into the wall, groaning along with the wood. I attempt to get back to my feet, only to end up sliding back to the ground.
		
I look up at Sydero to see her breathing heavier than usual, whatever she just did seemed to have drained her. The two of us stare daggers at one another before she disappears, going back into the room. It would seem that I would have to do this on my own.

&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
“I did what you said, and this still happened,” I tell her. This catches her attention, she freezes and turns to face me. Whether she was going to tell me off again, or actually entertain whatever plan I concoct, I don’t care. I just wish for her to hear me out and help me save a life.

“The only reason I picked up this time was because it seemed drastic, and it was. But any other time I followed your directions.”
		
“Besides cutting off your phone.” I stare at her, and she in return waits for a reply. Failing to receive one, she nods before heading towards her room.

“So that’s it? You&#39;re not even gonna help me?” The door closes.

Deep breaths, I tell myself. After I do take a few calming breaths, I question how stupid my plan is, and why I thought this would work at all. Here I was standing outside a motel room where my best friend was being held hostage by supernatural creatures. At least now Chris would believe me. The thought did little to ease my racing heartbeat.

I shuffle to the left and gaze through the window of Room 25, not being able to see much thanks to the curtain. I make out two guys in black, but that was it. I move back, trying to think of a game plan.

[[Go in, kick ass, and take names.]]

&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
I’ve probably watched one too many TV shows. Not to mention that most of the folks who say that either are superheroes skilled at what they do or usually get their butts beat. I had a single silver blade that was given to me by Sydero, with no knowledge of how to use it.

I summon all of my courage and energy, eyeing the door. First things first, how was I going to get inside?

[[Bust the door down.]]
[[Knock politely.]]
[[Knock and then charge.]]

Sure, they didn’t seem like the type to sit and talk about their problems, but I had little choice. I only had a single silver blade given to me by Sydero, though I had no knowledge of how to use it.

I summon all of my courage and energy, eyeing the door. First things first, how was I going to get inside?

If Sydero didn’t want to help, that was her business. But I wasn’t about to let these men kill my best friend because of her. They might just believe me when I say that she didn’t agree to come, but that I could lead them to her. It wasn’t like she could get far, she had no car.

I go over to the door and feel for the silver blade that Sydero had given me out, bracing myself. I get my adrenaline going before charging the door, putting all of my strength behind it.

The door shakes slightly, but that’s about it. I fall to the ground, moaning in agony as my entire left side is in pain. I hear the door open and see a man walk over to me, he has a gigantic smile on his face, amused at my failed attempt. He yanks me to my feet with one fluid motion, dragging me inside the room, and closing the door behind him.

There are six men in all and thanks to the size of the room, they each look menacing in their own way. Two sit on the bed, and I instantly recognize them. The officers that I already had the pleasure of dealing with. One man guards the only entrance and exit, and two men stand off to the side as if awaiting orders. Chris is in the middle of the room, tied and gagged to a dining room chair. The sixth man stands behind Chris, his back to me.

“$name, I’m guessing?”

“Who are you?”

“Where’s the girl?” It seems like all supernatural creatures had a distinct problem with answering questions. They either posed another question or ignored it altogether.

&lt;&lt;if $snitch&gt;&gt;\
	“She refused to come, but I can take you to where she is.” I observe the room, and my situation, for the second time. I was highly outnumbered, and I knew for a fact that two of the six were a werewolf and a shapeshifter. 
	
	Fighting was out of the question.

	“She refused to come, but I’m here.” I observe the room, and my situation, for the second time. I was highly outnumbered, and I knew for a fact that two of the six were a werewolf and a shapeshifter. Fighting was out of the question.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“That wasn’t the deal,” he laughs.

“Neither was hurting my friend, but I see he’s bleeding.” The man finally turns to me. He was completely bald, the only hair residing on his face, besides eyebrows, is a semi-full beard. It was trimmed just enough to show that he still cared about personal grooming. His eyes were an expressionless grey, monochrome and as dull as any average metal. His eyes take me in, and once he’s done, there is what resembles curiosity in them.

“I do believe Langston said he wouldn’t hurt your friend,” motioning to the grinning man who sat beside his stoic partner, “I wasn’t part of that deal. Kill the boy.” Chris’s eyes come to life, landing on me and begging me for help.

I knock on the door, and the door immediately opens. A large man stands there, letting me in.

I feel for the silver blade that Sydero had given me and tap on the door, backing up as I wait. As soon as the door opens, I charge forward. I rush into the room, but someone trips me. My body lurches forward, and I skid across the rough carpeted ground. The headache that comes with the fall is there for only a minute before retreating, a rough hand yanking me to my feet.

Instead, I get a creative idea. What if I throw a rock at the window, bringing their attention to it, before I charge for the door? I go over the idea countless times, finding it to be the best one so far.
		
I feel for the silver blade that Sydero had given me and then search for a rock. Well, here goes nothing. I throw the stone at the window and after five seconds, charge for the door. It budges but does nothing else. Instead, my shoulder screams out in silent pain. I hear voices inside, many of them cussing about what was going on. That&#39;s when I feel someone appear over me, grabbing me and yanking me to my feet.

Yet the feeling evaporates when they suddenly begin laughing, all but the man who had just ordered my best friend’s death, he continues to eye me, as if deciphering a puzzle or clue. It was evident in his eye, he didn’t know what to make of me.

“Congratulations, you’ve been doing your homework,” the man begins, leaning his weight on the round dining table, “but that doesn’t mean you know how to use it.” The man near the door makes a move towards me.

The man grabs a blade and holds it close to the side of Chris’s face. Even muffled, his whimpering is audible.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

Yet, the man only sighs and trails the knife down Chris’s arm next. Blood slowly seeps from the open wound, crawling down his arm and to the floor where every single droplet takes their time falling. Out of the corner of my eye, I see Petri’s eyes take on a goldish tint, he snarls, and his canines appear.

“Now, why would I do that?” the man questions, standing behind Chris with the blade to his neck.

“He didn’t do anything; this is my fault.”

“It sure is.”

I can hear shouting and frantic screams. This was the distraction I needed, I lunge forward, feeling for Chris. When I do finally feel him, a hand grabs me.

I fight whoever grabs me, blindly kicking and punching out until I hear them groan. They release their grip, and I go back to Chris, grabbing my blade and doing my best to only cut the rope. It was a difficult task, but the minute I hear Chris make a high pitched muffled sound, I know he’s free. Suddenly another hand grabs me, but it lets me go a moment later.
			
I now hear the familiar sound of my car’s engine and no longer the blazing heat of the light. I delicately open my eyes.

I again go towards Chris, but before I can even attempt to free him, another hold grabs onto me. This particular hold lets me go a moment later. I now hear the familiar sound of my car’s engine and can no longer feel the blazing heat of the light. I delicately open my eyes.

	“We can make a deal. You don’t have the girl, but you obviously want her, and I can get her.” I shout at him. He looks up at me, pausing but the blade still stays dangerously close to Chris’s neck.
				
	“What makes you think I can’t just kill him, and then torture you for her location afterward?”
				
	He was right, he could just go with that plan, but it would seem that he wouldn’t be able to. The sound of a window breaking grabs everyone’s attention, followed by another object that I can’t make out due to proximity.

&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“We can make a deal,” I shout at him. He looks up at me, but his motion doesn’t cease. In one fluid motion, he slices Chris’s throat without even blinking, his eyes still resting on me. Chris attempts to cough, but the tape over his mouth disables him from doing anything – screaming, coughing, whimpering, or talking. Blood gushes from his neck wound, dyeing his shirt as it seeps down. His eyes begin to flicker, and he soon goes limp in his seat.

	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
	
	“Now let’s talk about that deal,” the leader says to me. He suddenly appears in front of me, his hand clasping around my neck. He slowly raises me, my feet no longer touching the ground. I claw at his arm, but he fails to appear bothered. Suddenly, the window breaks and his eyes widen in shock.
	
	“Shield your eyes!” he shouts, letting me go. I shield them just as a bright light goes off. Even with my eyes closed I still can feel the burning sensation. I feel a hand grab me.

I didn’t bring him what he wanted, if he didn’t need me for anything, then he would kill me just as quickly as he was killing Chris.
			
I raise the blade to my throat, and the man freezes, slowly removing the blade from Chris’s neck. I have learned never to celebrate prematurely while in the presence of these men. He cocks his head to the side and points the bloody blade towards me.
			
“And what are you planning to do? Kill yourself?”
			
“Yes.”

He lets out a loud cry, grabbing the blade and turning his angered gaze to me.
			
“You’ll pay for that you brat!” he screams, stalking towards me and then grabbing me by my shirt. He rips the blade out of his chest, and gets ready to plunge the knife into mine when the leader ushers for him to stop, looking highly annoyed.
			
“But boss,” the man begins, but the look that the man gives him is enough to shut him up. The man backs away, my eyes still resting on my dagger held in his tight grip.

	“I don’t think that’s a good idea.”

	“Did I ask you for your opinion?” she asks, shooting me a glare that burns worse than the blinding light did. I raise my hands in surrender, and she makes her way towards the car again, passing me.

&#39;&#39;Back at the motel ...&#39;&#39;

The leader tucks his gun away, rubbing his temples as he stares at the two bodies resting before him. They were idiots, complete and useless idiots. One would think to cover their eyes when they heard someone scream it – who just screams something like that out for fun? They were lackeys, yes – but lackeys had to be replaced, and they were worthless if they were blinded for life. Yet, that wasn’t the only thing that angered him. This was the second group he has had to put down, all because of the same spell, because of the same damn bitch.

“Clean up all the dead crap in this room,” he tells the only lackey to survive. He scratches his forehead and takes a seat on the bed, ignoring the screeching of the mattress. He knew this job wasn’t going to be easy, but he never believed it would end up this hard.

“What do you want us to do about the tracking ordeal?” Petri asks upon approach.

“Were you able to get $his scent?”

“No, sir. Whatever cleansing spell she put on $him was strong, in fact, it’s still messing with my nose now,” he admits, whimpering at the last bit of information. His nostrils were burning due to the smell.

“Let them go for now then. When they slip up, we’ll find them. Besides, I doubt they’ll get far, she’s about out of energy, and I need to go discuss our new friend with a colleague.”
&lt;&lt;if $chrissafe is false&gt;&gt;\

	“Would you like me to burn the bodies?” the last lackey asks nervously, after gathering them all in one area. He waves his hand, giving him the signal to do whatever his little mind could think of, but froze mid-wave.
	
	“Actually, keep the boy’s body. I think I might find a use for it.”
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $cp is false&gt;&gt;\
	&lt;&lt;set $ChrisRichardson = false&gt;&gt;

[[Next Time on Superstition-&gt;EP2NT]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="379" name="A4_1" tags="" position="6150,1100" size="100,100">“This is your fault!” she murmurs sitting on the ground with her back to a tree, “every wrong and twisted thing that has happened to you has been your fault. I say forget everything. You don’t. I say forget your old life, you don’t. Don’t talk to anyone who calls, you do. So, congratulations, you have now brought your friend into it.” She stands up, continuing to breathe heavy and spit out blood.

“Next time, next time I’m not going to the be hero.” That is all she says before bending over again, resting her hands on her knees. When she does straighten up she doesn’t look any better, though she tries to play it off as is if she’s okay.

“Now. What do we do with the oddball?” We both turn to Chris who is standing awkwardly to the side. Though he’s looking at me, he seems distant, as if his mind is somewhere else. I can easily sympathize with him, at least he didn’t see anyone die.

“I can go home. I won’t tell anyone what I saw here,” he reassures.

“I don’t care who you tell, not like they’ll believe you anyway,” Sydero mumbles, rolling her eyes.
	
&lt;&lt;if $chriscall&gt;&gt;\
	“How would you get home?” I question, “we can’t go get your car cos it’s back at the motel. And I don’t think you’d be safe at home. If they knew to follow you here, then they probably know a whole lot more about you.”
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“How would you get home?” I question, “your car isn&#39;t here. And I don’t think you’d be safe at home. How did they even know to grab you and then bring you here? What happened, what do you remember?”
		
	“I was at work when they came in and asked to speak to me, this was the second time they asked to. I went with them and next thing I know I’m being jumped and knocked out. I heard them say something about tracking you.”
		
	“You’re getting a new phone,” I hear Sydero groan, and the look she gives me is less than pleased.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“So, what?&quot; Chris asks, &quot;are you trying to say going home isn’t safe?” I nod sadly, and Sydero reaffirms what I say. Chris shakes his head but doesn’t say anything; instead he paces back and forth. I look over at Sydero who has managed to find her way to the ground, looking over at Chris with a poker face.

[[Continue-&gt;A4_2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="380" name="A4_2" tags="" position="6256,1103" size="100,100">“Then I come with you,” Chris finally says, a small amount of hope in his eyes, but mostly sorrow and fear.

“Absolutely not. No. Hell no,” Sydero growls, throwing me a look, questioning if I was going to agree to this. “I have enough on my plate trying to save $him. And if you’re anything like your friend, then you’ll just be a pain in my ass.”

“It’s either that or I hide somewhere, and I’m not accustomed to that sort of life,” Chris argues.

“I don’t care. I’m not accustomed to having a travel partner, let alone two. Go cry someone else a river.” Seeing that he wouldn’t be able to get through to Sydero, Chris puts all of his attention on me.

“$name, please. What if they find me even if I go into hiding? I don’t want to die,” he whimpers.

“Sounds like a personal problem,” Sydero grumbles. Chris had a point, but he was more likely to find his death traveling with us, than on his own. Could I truly fault Chris for his reaction? Was this not how I was when I was asking Sydero to allow me to travel with her?

&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
“I think your best bet is to join us,” I tell him, feeling the glare Sydero gives me before her eyes even land on me.
			
“Are you crazy? I barely wanted to drag you along. Now you’re trying to drag your friend into it?”
			
“No matter how you look at it, he’s in danger now. His best bet at survival is sticking with us.”
			
“No, his best bet is to get on the first bus out of here and live out the rest of his life in some confused, unhealthy mental meltdown state.”
			
“That sounds horrible,” Chris finds himself saying, resting his hand on his chest.
			
“Better than the alternative, you dead,” she informs with a shrug.

“I still think his best chance is with us.”

“Well, maybe you should stop thinking. You haven’t been living this life for even a week, and if you haven’t noticed, you’re not doing a good job.” I remain unperturbed, while every second that passes sees Sydero growing angrier.

“Do me a favor, run me over with your car,” she growls and shakes her head. She trudges back to the car, heading towards the driver’s seat. I start to protest when she sends me a heated glare, I allow her to have it. I need to focus on Chris anyway.

She starts the car back up, and Chris and I get in as she gets back on the road, driving off.

&lt;&lt;set $sydero +=5&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
“I think Sydero’s right, your best option is to get on a bus and disappear. Not going home, but somewhere else.”

“So ... starting over somewhere else?” Chris asks sadly, tears threatening to run down his face. I agree, doubting he would last long. He would probably cave in and head home. Perhaps he would be safe if he did later on, when the heat around him died down.

Whether he wishes to argue, Chris merely nods. Sydero looks at me before trudging back to the car, heading towards the driver’s seat. I start to protest when she sends me a heated glare, I allow her to have it. I would probably never see Chris again after this, it was better to spend as much time as I could with him.

She starts the car back up and gets back on the road, driving off.

A few minutes later we find the local bus stop, and I prepare to tell Chris goodbye.

“Be careful,” I command.

“Yea, I’ll be fine,” he reassures me, but everything about his words screams the opposite. Who would be fine? Chris knew the supernatural existed and unless he learned more himself, he would never know more than just that broad fact. He was tortured and kidnapped, and all because of who he was associated with. I did this to him, regardless if my actions directly influenced this or not.

“Um, look, $name. I won’t tell anyone what I witnessed so don’t worry. But, take care of yourself, you got yourself in some deep stuff.” I nod in agreement. The sound of a bus approaching catches all of our attention. Chris gives me an alarmingly tight hug, one that I can feel he doesn’t wish to step back from. When he finally does, he rubs at his eye, clearing his throat.

“I swear, when I pictured us not talking, I thought it’d be because we just grew apart, and even that thought scared me. You’re my best friend, $name. I know we get into arguments and stuff, but I ... they were never ...” he struggles to find the exact words he’s looking for, choking on some of his words as he goes on. I give him another hug, knowing what he meant and knowing that words would never be able to describe what we had experienced together all these years.

[[Yea, no. Can’t do it. Chris is coming with us.]]

I was a bit jealous of him, he was able to walk away from this. I, well, I was stuck in it for who knows how long.
					
I turn and head back to the passenger’s seat of the car, Sydero getting in as well. Neither of us says anything as she drives off, heading in the opposite direction of the bus.

“This is one of my safehouses. What, you think I just put in a random address?”

“I did, actually. Why abandoned houses? And if you’re going to choose abandoned houses then why not at least make them more ... presentable.”

“Does it look like I’m the type to have company? The more rundown they look, the better. I don’t need water or electricity, just a roof.”

“And mice?” I say this as I glare at one that stares back at me. Apparently, I was the intruder here.

My heart thumps wildly as only one face appears in my mind. I grab my phone to see my thoughts proven correct, a goofy photo of Chris stares back at me. My stomach twists and knots up immediately. The feeling of a hundred tiny needles pricking my inner stomach harshly.

He brandishes the paper that was hidden behind his back, but his constant shaking made it utterly impossible to even see what it meant.

I snatch the paper from his hands, quietly looking it over as he continues to hop from foot to foot. Unless I was missing something, this paper was filled with nothing but a jumble of letters and numbers.

“Should I know what this is?” I question, handing it back to him.

“No one but a //pledge// who has been chosen to undergo the initiation would know what it means.” It takes me a while to figure out what he means by this, but when it finally does, I’m almost more excited than he is.

“Congrats, Chris! I know you went through hell for this.” Literally. Chris had gone MIA for an entire week due to Hell Week. He didn’t show up to classes, I’m not sure if he missed tennis practice, and I know damn well he didn’t contact me for that entire time. It got so bad that even his mom texted me to see if everything was okay.
	
He collapses onto my bed, his limbs sprawled out and narrowly missing me.

“I’m finally here though. After everything,” he sits up, “do you know how many times I wanted to quit? To just drop out?”

“Yes, Chris. Before you disappeared you constantly brought it up,” I chuckle, flipping the page and peering back at the first discussion question. Would missing this discussion hurt my grade? They were only fifteen points apiece.

“Well, did I tell you that you were a big reason why I didn’t?” I freeze, staring from my open book to Chris who continues to stare at the ceiling, a pleasant smile on his face.

“You’re kidding?” He glances over at me, shaking his head without breaking eye contact.

“Remember when I told you I wanted to rush? Do you remember what you said to me?”

&quot;Not like how I wanted to. I don&#39;t know why I keep trying to please that man, after everything.&quot; He joins me by the sofa and collapses, rubbing his temples.

I&#39;ve known Chris for a handful of months, enough to have formed an idea about him, and enough to have heard stories of his family.

Chris offers me a thankful smile, “you did.”

He takes a deep, satisfied breath and stretches out before sitting up, “all the times I felt like I couldn’t, I don’t know, I thought about you and all the shit we’ve been through.”

“We’ve known each other for less than a year,” I remind him, though I did understand where he was coming from. Ever since we introduced one another in freshman seminar and found out we lived on the same dorm floor, well, we’ve been inseparable.

“And yet you are literally my closest friend. I had friends in high school, but I don’t know if I ever felt this connection with someone else.” He leans up, looking the most content that I’ve ever seen him. “I don’t know. I just feel like everything is working out and I have such a good life. My dreams are coming true, my future is starting to unfold, and I have a friendship that others only wish they could have.”

We were in the suburbs. I look around curiously, these weren’t abandoned houses. These were actually inhabitable houses whose homeowners cared about appearances. Hopefully, we weren’t just driving through.

She turns into an empty driveway, cutting the car off.
	
“Another safehouse?”

“No.”

“I’m a witch as well. I have the unique talent of being able to see a person’s memories. The longer I touch them, the more I see.”

“That’s extraordinary,” I exclaim.

“No, it’s a curse. Rarely do I ever see happy memories or something that brings joy. Everyone in this life has lost someone, has seen nothing but hurt. It doesn’t get better, it only stops hurting when you have nothing left to lose. Why would you want this life?”

&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

&quot;Yea, if Tinkerbell was a maniac with razor-sharp teeth and an attitude worse than a wolverine’s. They&#39;re not the nicest, fairytales rarely get supernatural creatures right.&quot;

“Um, excuse me, your royal faerie highness,” I begin, not exactly knowing what to call her, “what does this ritual entail exactly?”
		
“A ritual to replenish our forests and our magic,” her eyes narrow on me with glee, “a ritual that calls for human sacrifices.”

I swallow the lump in my throat, running my lips over my dry lips. My heart quakes and aches every second I look back at him. I was thankful he was looking at me. Or was I? Did I want him to see the pain I was in, the pain that only he could make better? Chris was straight. I knew this to be a fact, but that did little to cure my want for him.
			
“Alright, that’s enough,” he chuckles, picking himself off of my bed and clapping his hands, “let’s go celebrate or something, on me.” I nod, noticing my throat was dry. //Straighten up, $name//, I scold myself, my eyes landing on Chris as he heads towards the door, allowing me to get ready. //You’ll never have him.//

“Oh, for real?” Chris laughs, and I can’t help but do so as well, it was a contagious laugh that was nothing but good-natured. It was rare for Chris to ever get sappy, he wasn’t the type. He pats my leg and gets to his feet, “let’s go celebrate or something, on me.” I nod, and Chris claps happily before leaving my room, allowing me to get ready.

I offer him a gentle smile and place my hand atop of his. He looks over at me, our eyes meeting. I forget about the words that I had planned to say, too busy getting lost in those eyes of his. Somewhere we end up leaning towards one another, a magnetic force drawing us closer. But suddenly the main door to my suite slams closed. We both jump apart, and I remove my hand, biting my cheeks to hide the blush.

I feel someone lightly shake me awake and look around to see that the car was parked in a mostly empty store parking lot. This perhaps is due to the late hour.

“I’ll be back, I have to grab something before we reach our location,” Sydero states, opening the door and getting out before I reach out and stop her.

“Which you still haven’t told me.” She ignores me, to the point where for a second, I doubt if I had said the words loud enough. She walks towards the store, leaving me in the quiet car, in the horribly lit parking lot.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	The only positive to this was that I wasn’t the only one in the car, a loud yawn from behind me reminds me of that.
	
	“Good ... night?” I ask in confusion, not knowing exactly what to say. Most of the ride Chris has either been knocked out or asking questions. I answered most of them since Sydero refused to speak. But the longer the ride went on, the more she talked and responded to questions that both of us came up with. She was still upset, her ignoring me just minutes ago was proof of that. But she wasn’t as upset as she was before.
	
	“Where are we? What are we doing?”
	
	“You know, everything that comes out of your mouth now is a question,” I point out, and he sighs.
	
	“I noticed that too ... shit, this is all for real, isn’t it? And I thought my life was fucked up before. And I feel stupid as hell for not believing you, but damn I wished you were making this up. Vampires, werewolves, werecats, the fuck is a werecat,” he questions, and I laugh.
	
	“Yea. It took me a few minutes to get used to it too, and there’s stuff I still don’t know. You should read those books back there, they answer a lot of questions. It helps to know what we’re running into.”
	
	“I don’t want to know, is that bad?”
	
	[[“Yea, you need to be prepared.”]]
	[[“I understand, but you should either way.”]]
	[[“No, it’s not.”]]
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	&lt;&lt;if $chrissafe&gt;&gt;\
		I rest my head on the seat’s headrest, unable to think of anything else but Chris. The only thing that keeps me from cursing myself out is that I know he’s safe. Or at least the last time I saw him he was. How long that would be, I could only guess.
		
		&lt;&lt;if $optimistic &gt;= 50&gt;&gt;\
			He would be okay, Chris wasn’t stupid, and I think he understood the trouble he could possibly get in if he doesn’t heed the warnings both I and Sydero gave him.
		&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
			Knowing Chris, he wouldn’t survive long. He would overthink everything and believe that it was safe to go home. There, he would meet his end, all because he didn’t listen. I take a shaky breath, it was wrong to think such thoughts, but it was impossible for me not too.
		&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
		I rest my head on the seat’s headrest, unable to think of anything else but Chris. My brain decides to conjure up the image of him dying, the look in his eyes when his throat was slit. That was my best friend, and I got him killed.
	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
	
	I need to think about something else ...

Judging by his socialness and his love for doing things, I would say going out, even if to the mall, would help.
	
&quot;Mind coming with me to the mall? I&#39;ve been wanting to check out that new store that just opened up.&quot; He perks up and nods his head. Before I can say anything more, he dashes into his room, and I hear his keys jingling and him fuss over the placement of his wallet. I smirk and go retrieve my things as well. The mall wasn&#39;t that far away, and it was a beautiful day, we would walk.
			
Chris comes back up looking like his old self, that giant smile on his face, brightening up what were once cloudy eyes.
			
&quot;Hey,&quot; he begins, gently touching my arm, &quot;I just want to say thanks, $name. I know what you&#39;re doing, and the fact that you want to help is enough. It really means a lot, and I appreciate it.&quot;

I knew his family was traditional, I even remember him telling me that he didn&#39;t have any minority groups in most of his middle school classes. But saying that one&#39;s family is traditional or conservative could mean a lot, it wasn&#39;t exactly a bad thing, and Chris never went deep into it.
			
&quot;Do you want to talk about it?&quot; I finally ask, not knowing what else to suggest or say. I was a good listener, that much I knew.
			
&quot;No, I&#39;d rather not sit here and think about it, especially since I can&#39;t change shit. I&#39;ll be fine, I&#39;m just going to go do homework and listen to music.&quot; I nod slowly, wondering if I had said the wrong thing when Chris gently touches my arm, pulling me from my thoughts.

The only thing I can think of to do is to get his mind off of it entirely as if nothing had happened at all.
			
&quot;Hey, I still need to kick your butt in that racing game,&quot; I point out, getting up and walking to the TV, cutting on the console and grabbing both remote controls. I hold out his, and he stares at it before sneering, taking it and sending me a cocky smile.
			
&quot;You mean you want to redeem yourself since I beat you last time?&quot;
			
&quot;You cheated.&quot;
			
&quot;You can&#39;t even cheat in this game,&quot; he shouts, his words cut off by his own laughing.
			
&quot;You definitely can since that&#39;s what you did.&quot; I load up the game, smiling as I go through the motions. I&#39;m not exactly sure if I hear him right, but I swear I hear him thank me.

I wonder if Sydero just had a bag of them and was planning to give one to him anyway. Chris nods in understanding, but he fails to look happy about it.

“So, Sydero? What’s her deal?”
	
“That’s a question that I can’t answer because I’m still trying to figure it out. She’s a witch with a really short temper, sarcasm is her first language, and heartless is first nature to her.”
	
“Can’t be too heartless, she came for you. Plus, she let me stay. I mean, she had a big problem with it but if she really didn’t care, wouldn’t she had just dropped me off somewhere by now? You too?” I shrug, catching sight of her coming towards the car, a bag in her hands.

	&quot;Wow, Syd, a new traveling buddy, this is different.&quot;
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“Let’s not dwell on it, I know I try not to.”

Faye chuckles lightly at Sydero&#39;s words, offering her hand for us to shake, “So, what brings you here of all places?”

“A number of things, but it’s late. Do you mind if we stay here for a few days?” Sydero asks. Her question sounding sincere enough. Faye bites the inside of her cheek, visibly unsure about agreeing to her request.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	Her eyes move to Chris and I. I don’t know what she sees but whatever it is causes her features to soften. She nods and guides us deeper into her home.

Her house is quaint and has a nice homey feel to it. It was the type of home someone could live the rest of their days in. The walls were a soft chocolate cream, standing out against the glossed over dark wooden floors. The furniture was all cream colored with splashes of orange. I notice that she has no family photos, no photos whatsoever. She has one abstract painting hanging on a wall, one that looks like a jumbled-up mess that serves absolutely no purpose.

Now that I actually noticed the single painting, the rest of her house actually seems even less decorated than I realized before.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“Alright,” Faye begins, coming back holding a pillow and blanket, “I have a guest room with a bed, but that’s about it. So, two of you could sleep in the bed and one on the sofa. Work it out how you want. My room is down that hall, and the bathroom is right beside it. Upstairs, the first door to your right, is the other bathroom. Please, take showers, some of you don’t smell so good.” I sigh, ignoring Chris’s soft chuckle and Sydero’s nonchalant whistling.

Faye disappears down the hallway after telling us goodnight, and I turn to discuss sleeping plans.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\

Sydero and Chris both gaze at one another, sizing each other up since they were about to have to sleep in the same bed.
			
“You better not snore,” Sydero growls, pushing past Chris and heading towards the stairs. Chris whimpers before telling me goodnight. I watch them go, heading towards the shower. After freshening up I prepare for bed, wondering how the two of them were doing. I wouldn’t be surprised if one didn’t end up showing up tomorrow morning.
			
&lt;&lt;if $unclepicture&gt;&gt;\
	Even though I end up on a sofa, it&#39;s five-times better than anything I&#39;ve been forced to sleep on, it even rivals my own car. I reach into my bag and bring out the photo that I had taken from my uncle&#39;s place. I stare at it, training my brain to be able to look at the picture but to leave the memories where they belong, it was still too early. I wouldn&#39;t want to wake the entire house because I couldn&#39;t keep my sobs down. I put it away before the dam can break. Sinking into the comfort, it doesn’t take long for me to fall asleep.

	“I want the bed if you’re good with the sofa.”

To my surprise, she smirks, “won’t see me arguing.”
					
&lt;&lt;if $CRomance &gt;= 2&gt;&gt;\
	Before Sydero and I head up, I happen to see a look cross Chris&#39;s face. It was hard to name, seeing that I rarely ever see such an expression. But I swear it was envy, his eyes narrowing on Sydero as she makes her way up the stairs. Our eyes meet and a light blush appears before quickly fading, further pushing me to believe he was somewhat jealous of Sydero, but why? I crinkle my nose in confusion but question nothing, heading up the stairs.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

I get out of the shower before Sydero does, walking into the room that we were going to share. The guest bedroom is sparsely decorated. There aren’t any decorations on the wall, and besides a queen-sized bed and a dresser, nothing else is there. I suppose I shouldn’t have expected this room to be tremendously decorated, it was for guests, and something told me that Faye rarely had visitors.
	
The door reopens and in walks Sydero, carrying four large pillows. I open my mouth to question her, but no words escape, I just continue to stare at her. She throws them down on the bed, crossing her arms and narrowing her eyes towards me.
	
“What’s this?”
	
“This, is Don’t,” she picks up a pillow and places it at the head of the bed, “this is Fuck. And this is With. And finally, my favorite one, Me.”
	
“Don’t,” I start putting all the names she said together until coming to the obvious conclusion, “ahh, okay yea, you’re cute.” She goes to her side of the bed and begins to aggressively make a pillow wall.

“You’ve had a trying day, almost being killed and all. I think you should take the bed too.” Chris nods in obvious agreement. Out of the corner of my eye, I look at Sydero, to see if she would disagree. She doesn’t seem to care one way or another.

After both of us take our showers, we meet up in the room. Chris and I stare at the bed, both wondering how this was going to work out. Despite knowing the man for years, we’ve never been faced with this sort of dilemma.
	
We meet each other’s gazes at the same time, and Chris clears his throat.
	
“Any rules I should know about? Or quirks, you know, like snoring?”
	
“No, I’m pretty sure I don’t snore, but I wouldn’t really know. I guess Sydero would’ve said something. Actually, I’m positive Sydero would’ve said something.” He nods, the two of us still standing on opposing sides of the bed awkwardly. “You?”
	
“Oh no, I don’t snore. I mean, unless I’m really tired or sick, then I guess I wouldn’t know.”
	
“Cool, cool.” My voice trails off, and I rock back and forth, both of us waiting for the other one to make the first move.
	
“Well, I’m going to go ahead and go to sleep, kinda tired,” Chris informs me, and I nod. Why were we being so awkward? Sure, we’ve never had to share a bed, but there’s been plenty of times where we’ve shared a room. I get into bed, stretching out and relaxing, sighing happily at the plush mattress resting under me. I find Chris preparing to take off his shirt.

Faye stands at the oven, singing along to the electronic jazz song that’s currently playing. When she sees me, she winks, motioning to the food.

“You eat meat or strictly fruit?”

“This bed is just barely big enough to fit two people, not two people and your vulgar fluff wall.”
	
“My vulgar fluff wall isn’t going anywhere.” She finishes setting up the wall when I attempt to grab one, seeing the idiotic nature of all of this. Before my hands are fully rested upon the pillow, Sydero has me backing into a wall. She stands a few inches taller than me, enough to make it so that I had to tilt my head slightly upwards to see her.

“If I wake up and that pillow wall is tampered with, in any kind of way, you will pay.”

“Don’t touch my wall,” is all she says before she moves back and heads over to her side of the bed.
			
I awake in the middle of the night due to something hitting me roughly. I groggily awake, finding a dark figure staring at me.
			
“What?” I growl, noticing the lack of a pillow wall, “oh look, your pillow wall is gone.” I yawn and turn my back to her, about to drift back to sleep.
			
“Oh no you don’t. Roe, your snoring is keeping the entire neighborhood awake.”
			
“I’m sleepy, I can’t help that,” I answer, shaking her hand off my back as I bury my face deeper into the softness of the pillow.

“Roe,” Sydero growls again. I give in to her yanking, rolling over to look at her again.

“Make me stop,” I grin devilishly. It’s dark, and I can see nothing but her figure, but I can feel her heated gaze. At first, I believe it’s due to anger, but small things become clear to me, and I think differently. Her body is closer to mine, and her face is close enough to where my eyes can slowly make out distinct features. She leans in close and whispers, “don’t test me.”

As fast as she was there, she’s back on her side. But it’s too late. I’m fully awake now and the heat rising off my body isn’t necessarily due to how hot the room has gotten.

The next morning, the pillow wall is up again, and Sydero is gone.

I meet her gaze, refusing to drop eye contact despite the shiver that runs down my spine. It feels like forever goes by before she takes a step back, giving me one last look before going towards her side of the bed.

I awake in the middle of the night, up against something that feels nothing like a pillow. I manage to lazily open one eye, and the realization hits me, I was up against Sydero. I freeze, scared that breathing would wake her. My right-hand rests delicately on her hip, and my head was nestled up against her backside. I slowly remove my hand, and back away. I remake the pillow wall and put great space between me and it. I would be lucky if Sydero was a deep sleeper and realized nothing happened.

The next morning, the pillow wall is still up, and Sydero is gone.

[[Continue-&gt;C2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="425" name="Give him his privacy." tags="" position="1911,1906" size="100,100">I get comfortable and turn my back to him. Seconds later I feel his side of the bed dip and settle, the room growing deathly quiet.

“We’re being stupidly awkward, aren’t we?” I hear him ask and my shoulders relax as I laugh.

“Yea, we are. We’re best friends, this shouldn’t be awkward or anything.”

“Exactly. And we might as well get used to this, who knows what will happen in the future.”

“Count yourself lucky,” I tell him, resituating myself so that I’m staring up at the ceiling, out of the corner of my eye I see him doing the same. “I was sleeping in abandoned houses before this.”

“Wait, seriously?”

“Yea, a mouse was this close to my face,” I show the space that had rested between my face and the mouse, and he laughs. We continue talking into the night, though it was mostly me who was doing the talking. I was in no way an expert on all things supernatural, if Sydero were here, she’d probably get a kick out of listening to my attempts at answering his questions. But seeing that Chris was terrified of Sydero, he relied on me for answers, and I had no problem giving them. I answer his questions and tell him everything that has happened since I’ve been here, and anything we missed during the car ride.

The next morning, I awake to find the bed empty.

I stare at him as he does his nightly routine, allowing my eyes to take in his physique. I knew he liked to work out, especially since he would sometimes try to get me to come with him. But I rarely was ever able to bask in the view he was giving me now. His muscles weren’t overdone, like what some would expect the typical athlete to be. His muscles were sculpted just enough to make it evident that he spent time each day tending to them. His stomach flat but his abs not defined. A small amount of hair rests on both his chest and around his stomach, the same color as his hair.

His eyes meet mine, and I quickly look away, yawning and acting like I hadn’t just been caught staring at him. He gets into bed a moment later.

“Well, goodnight, $name,” he states, and I say it back, both of our backs to one another.

	That night, my dreams turn dark, darker than I typically fight with. A mix of the shadow dreams blends in with the death of my uncle.

It anchors me, reminding me of the difference between dream and reality. I feel my body calm.

“I’m a witch as well. I have the unique talent of being able to see a person’s memories. The longer I touch them, the more I see.”

“That’s extraordinary,” I exclaim.

“No, it’s a curse. Rarely do I ever see happy memories or something that brings joy. Everyone in this life has lost someone, has seen nothing but hurt. It doesn’t get better, it only stops hurting when you have nothing left to lose.

	“Hunters are anyone who hunt supernatural creatures whether for revenge, the heck of it, or because they think it’s what’s right. Anyone can be a hunter, and most of the folks you meet will be.” Her eyes search mine, “you’ll be a hunter.”
	
	“But you aren’t?” I question, noticing that she placed the title on everyone but herself.
	
	“You can’t be a hunter when others may seek to hunt you. That, and I don’t do shit for free. I’m what you would call a specialist. Anyone who hunts for money or some other sort of payment is. Most specialists have a select group that they hunt or an interesting way of doing things.”

“The young and the foolish,” Faye murmurs, but Sydero gives me a nod of approval with a wide smirk. Dare I say she&#39;s almost proud of me?

Before I can question Faye further, Sydero clears her throat, rising and walking towards the sink. Faye gives me a sympathetic smile, before returning to her seat.
&lt;&lt;if $bedmoment_Sydero&gt;&gt;\
	
	Before Sydero moves away, she stops at my side.
	
	“Next time you feel like drooling on my back, at least try to clean it up. It’s disgusting.” My eyes widen. Whether I actually did what she accused me of or not, it meant that she knew I had broken the pillow wall and gotten close to her, very close. If anything, other than the so-called ‘drool’ bothered her, she didn’t express it.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“Alright, Faye, let’s get started,” Sydero says, leaving before coming back in with her bag from earlier. She brings out two wine bottles, handing them to an expecting Faye.

“1995 Pinot Noir, aren’t you a doll, Syd,” Faye grins. She immediately goes to pour herself a glass and once happy, takes a seat, “what do you need then?”

“I need your help identifying the man hunting us. As well as something else, something personal.”

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	Both pairs of eyes land on me and I clear my throat awkwardly.

	“$name,” Faye begins, “I have some car washing liquid and sponges underneath the sink, even a few gallons of gas in the garage. How about you and Chris go pay that car of yours some attention?” Whether I want to disagree or not, it doesn’t seem entirely possible. Faye posed it like a suggestion, but everything else screamed that it was more than that. I look to Chris who nods, happy to do something and get his mind off of our most recent events.

		“Were you serious when you said that you were excited about becoming a hunter?”
	
		“Uh, yea I was.” Before I can further explain myself, Chris growls and pushes himself off the hood, pacing back and forth.
		
		“How can you say that? This isn’t our life. Why do you seem so okay with this?”

		“Hey, $name,” Chris begins, I glance towards him to see him leaning on the hood, his eyes studying my face. I suddenly feel as if I was under a microscope, a new species waiting to be discovered.
		
		“Do you really want to get away from this? To live some peaceful life like Faye?”

		“Yea, but you heard her, it&#39;s not possible.” 

		&quot;No, she said it&#39;s rare. But she did say that some accomplish it.&quot;

		&quot;And what? You think we could? Maybe you can, Chris, but these guys have already shown their want to kill me. Leaving to try and live some simple life, especially not knowing all that I need to know, is suicide.&quot; Chris growls and pushes himself off the hood, pacing back and forth.
		
		“You don&#39;t know that. The further we get in this, the harder it will be to leave, to get away. This isn’t our life. Why do you seem so okay with this?”
	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
	
	[[“Because I’d rather not die.”]]
	[[“I’m not okay with this.”]]

	I go grab the hose and begin spraying the car. I was happy to be finally able to wash the car, but this was the last thing on my mind. I find myself glancing towards the house numerous of times, wondering what they were talking about. The past few days run through my mind, everything that took place makes its daily rounds.

	I hear the door close and see Sydero approach. I mentally prepare for some sort of insult or jabbing tease, but nothing comes. Instead, she walks up and grabs a sponge from my soapy bucket.

	“Deep in thought?” she questions. I nod as I continue washing my side of the car.

	“Bet you don’t ever have a problem with that huh? Having guilt on your conscience?”
	
	She chuckles and shrugs, “you’d be correct. I don’t have friends, I have acquaintances at best. Friends, people you care about, those are weaknesses.” I stop, raising an eyebrow at her and the message she was beginning to preach. It was an old yet interesting trope, the idea that love was either a weakness or a strength. It was obvious what Sydero saw it as.

	“Do we really have to have this conversation? The which is love, strength or weakness?” She snorts, scrubbing at what I perceive to be a hard to get splotch. After she does get it, she lets out a satisfied huff and looks at me.

	“There’s no conversation, love and caring for others is a weakness. Sure, there are elements that can give it strength, but at the end of the day, it’ll kill you. There are just too many things that that amount of care opens you up to. Better to keep your distance.”

	“Is this you trying to convert me?” She puts her sponge back in the bucket and turns to me.

	“This is me warning you. For every new hunter, ten other hunters die, and it’s always because they were either foolish and did something stupid, or because caring and love got in the way. You want to live? You need to know that at the end of the day, the only one who cares about your life is you.” She takes a second look at the car. “Once you’re done, I have a task that I need your help with.” 

	With that, she leaves, letting me soak in her message and finish up my car. I spray down the car again, allowing the water to clear the remaining soap suds. Love is a weakness, the only one who cares about my life is myself ...

I roll my eyes and look at him quizzically. “Because Chris, not being okay with this means we’ll end up dead. This is survival, and I will do anything I need to to survive. Why did you agree and say you wanted to come along if you were only going to complain?”

“Because I want to live, $name,” he snaps back, “some of us still have parents and loved ones that haven’t died yet.” The world seems to slow and then come to a standstill with his words.

“There’s no conversation, love and caring for others is a weakness. Sure, there are elements that can give it strength, but at the end of the day, it’ll kill you. There are just too many things that that amount of care opens you up to. Better to keep your distance.”

“Is this you trying to convert me?” She puts her sponge back in the bucket and walks over to me, setting the bucket down next to mine.

“This is me warning you. For every new hunter, ten other hunters die, and it’s always because they were either foolish and did something stupid, or because caring and love got in the way. You want to live? You need to know that at the end of the day, the only one who cares about your life is you.” She takes a second look at the car. “Once you’re done, I have a task that I need your help with.” 

With that, she leaves, letting me soak in her message and finish up my car. I spray down the car again, allowing the water to clear the remaining soap suds. Love is a weakness, the only one who cares about my life is myself ...

At the end of the day everyone really only cares about themselves. That’s not saying that people don’t have feelings for others but truly, how many people would give their life for another? Love could be a strength, yes. But most often than not it only brought trouble.

Love wasn’t a weakness. There was indeed cons and pros, but the strengths of love far outweighed the weaknesses. At the end of the day, you’d be surprised at how many people cared about you. How many people weren’t of a selfish mindset and did wish to see you alive and well.

No one was right. Too many factors go into it, and a traumatic event could easily warp one’s perspective on the matter. I don’t know how I feel about it, but I also just started this. I had no choice but to trust Sydero. If she was working selfishly, then there wasn’t much I could do. She was my guide into a world that I knew little to nothing about.

Before finding her in the kitchen, I realize that Faye is nowhere to be seen. My mind goes back to whatever they had talked about, a large piece of me wanting to find out.

[[Ask Sydero about the talk.]]
[[Don’t ask Sydero about the talk.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="445" name="Ask Sydero about the talk." tags="" position="2712,1911" size="100,100">“So,” I begin, all the different ways that this can go wrong appear in my head, “what did you and Faye find out?&quot; I try to pose the question differently than I initially thought.
		
“Nothing that we don’t already know. She’s upstairs doing more research on our kind kidnapper, she should be back soon and hopefully with news.”
		
&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“Kidnapper? You mean the guy who was two seconds away from killing me?” Chris questions. Sydero nods, and he takes a long and deep breath, covering his face in his hands.
			
	“Why the hell are we even looking for him? Shouldn’t we be trying to get away from him?” He cuts his eyes towards me, apparently still upset about our argument earlier. I don’t really see why he was the one that was upset, he was the one insinuating that I was some sort of death curse.

	“We’re not looking for him, smart-ass,” Sydero growls, matching his attitude with one of her own. “We’re learning about him to make sure to avoid him, and if we are found again, how to get away.”
	
	&lt;&lt;if $motive is &quot;revenge&quot;&gt;&gt;\
		“Wait, what? Avoid him? I want to bring this guy down not avoid him.” They both roll their eyes at me. Apparently, I was the only one with enough anger to still want his head on a plate.
	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
	&lt;&lt;if $motive is &quot;survival&quot;&gt;&gt;\
		“Makes sense, he doesn’t really seem like the type to let someone escape him twice.” My brain attempts to think of what would happen if we run into him again, but I shake my head, no thanks.
	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
	&lt;&lt;if $motive is &quot;justice&quot;&gt;&gt;\
		“I’m not against hiding, but how is this bringing him to justice?” Chris is unable to answer and Sydero just rolls her eyes at my motive, probably finding it silly.

	“What I wanted to talk about though is another matter. We need to attract the attention of a faerie,&quot; Sydero begins, flipping through //The Lore// until she finds a picture of one. She turns the book to us, and I cringe at the sight.

	&quot;Aww, you mean like Tinkerbell?&quot; Chris asks before he can see a picture of what his Tinkerbell looks like.

	&quot;Yea, if Tinkerbell was a maniac with razor-sharp teeth and an attitude worse than a wolverine’s.&quot; Both of us frown at her words, &quot;they&#39;re not the nicest, fairytales rarely get supernatural creatures right.&quot; This faerie had long, lanky arms with three fingers at the end. Their faces were longer than a normal human, and the ears were elven like. They had large evil eyes without an iris, and their legs were bent at the knee.

	“So all that shit I hear about faeries? Completely false?” Chris inquires.

	“Eh, it’s true they love parties and having fun, but that’s when they’re among their own kind.”

	“What do you need us to do exactly? How do we attract their attention?” I ask next.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“What do you need me to do exactly? How do we attract their attention?” I ask.

&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“Sounds easy enough. Why are we looking for faeries?” The room grows silent, a cue that Sydero wasn’t going to answer me. She takes a sip of whatever beverage is in her favorite mug, her eyes lazily reading over the words in front of her.

	I agree to the plan, and Sydero tells us the best place to find the faeries. She gives us directions along with a glittering bowl, some milk, cut up fruit slices, and lavender scented candles. It all seems simple enough.
	
	She hands me a jar, “let them drink all the milk first, once they do, capture and put them in this jar. They should be too slow to escape. Come back when you got one.” I nod and leave with Chris a moment later.

&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

Honeycutt Forest sounds like something out of a children’s storybook. Some forest where all the magical creatures exist and live in peace and understanding of each other and nature. The appearance of the forest didn’t sway far from the name. Knowing that supernatural creatures exist, I wonder if my first storybook thought was that far off.

The forest was beautiful and occupying it was a serene feeling. Tall birch trees outline a trail, while oak trees reside further in. The forest was made up of green, golden, and orange tones, each complimenting one another. The white of the birch trees contrasted but only caused the beauty of the forest to pop more. Clutters of dandelions litter the ground, including the trail, reminding me of some mystical pathway towards an unknown destination.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“This is beautiful,” I find myself saying aloud, though I don’t expect Chris to say anything. The entire ride here was silent, and Chris spent most of it glaring at the world on the other side of the window. 
	
	I fought against my thoughts, but in the end, they won out. Was bringing Chris along really the smartest thing? As far as I’ve seen, it was a horrible mistake. He didn’t want this, not really. I feel like I had just pushed my best friend into the worst, and possibly last, mistake he’s ever made.

	I continue forward, remembering Sydero’s advice for where to place everything. They were a fan of oak, so setting the trap near an oak tree was wise. I pour the milk and burn the lavender candles, while Chris places the fruit.

	“We can hide there,” I say, directing his attention to a cluster of nearby bushes.

	“What fun,” he mumbles. I ignore his tone, and after we finish, I head over. Not five minutes in and Chris speaks on his disgruntlement.

	“Are we seriously sitting here and entertaining the idea that faeries are real?”

	“Are we seriously having this discussion again? What do you not understand about the whole supernatural thing?” 

	“A lot, possibly because I’ve never seen one actually. That guy could’ve had a disease that caused his eyes to change, or it could’ve just been how the light had hit them. And his teeth, he could’ve done that, it’s not like he was sane. If those guys were supernatural creatures they wouldn’t have needed a knife.”
	
	[[“You’re in denial.”]]
	[[“Just one second, can you shut up for that long?”]]
	[[“Well, this is the best time to put your theory to the test.”]]
	[[Ignore Chris.]]
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“This is beautiful,” I find myself saying aloud, though there were no ears to hear me.

	I continue forward, remembering Sydero’s advice for where to place everything. They were a fan of oak, so setting the trap near an oak tree was wise. I pour the milk, place the fruit, and light the candles. Once done I retire to a cluster of bushes that rest nearby.
	
	The forest grows quiet. Seconds shift to minutes, and I swear that those transition into hours. My patience grows thin just as I hear a fluttering sound. I perk up but freeze when I realize that perking up involves making noise. 

	The shimmering stops and then starts again.

	As quietly as possible I attempt to resituate myself. I can’t see anything near my trap, but the shimmering continues to go. I move some more, and the noise I create is loud enough to scare the shimmering away. I growl, ready to cuss myself out when the noise comes back. This time it sounds like it’s right on top of me. I turn but see nothing there. I look back towards my untouched trap when suddenly a bright white light flashes and then darkness.

“So I just uprooted my entire life and joined two other people who agree that the supernatural exists? Is that it?

&#39;&#39;Back at Faye&#39;s place ...&#39;&#39;

Sydero lets out a loud and extensive yawn as her eyes skip from one word to the other. She couldn’t recall the last time she has had to actually research something. This being due to knowing far too much, survival required such knowledge. She glances at her almost empty mug, barely a spit of alcohol was left there. She usually wasn’t a drinker, but since meeting Roe, has acquired a taste for the stuff, that, and she always found that it helped her focus more.

“Well, I got nothing,” Faye says suddenly, walking into the kitchen. She lazily pours herself another glass of wine before collapsing into the seat. She takes a long sip of it, almost drinking all that she has poured.

“We’re getting nowhere with this,” Sydero points out, turning the page of one book.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“I didn’t come down here with all bad news. You said Chris has seen the guy, right? It’ll take a lot of focus, but maybe I can touch Chris and try to get some kind of sense for him. Maybe even learn something that Chris might’ve not thought was important.” Faye gazes around, just now noticing the lack of people around. “Where are they?”
	
	“I sent them faerie hunting.” The color drains from Faye’s face, and despite being mid-sip, her throat goes dry.

	“Syd, please tell me you didn’t use them as faerie bait?”
	
	“What’s the big deal. I sent them with milk, one of your weird and ugly glittering bowls, some lavender candles, and fruit. There’s no way they won’t catch one.”

	“Correct me if I’m wrong, but aren’t they both firstborn?”
	
	Sydero waves Faye’s worry away, again glancing at her empty mug, void of alcohol. Maybe it was the fact that she had to deal with people period that had Sydero craving the tingle that alcohol provides. “I already know about the whole firstborn and faerie thing, especially firstborn males. It’ll bring them in faster.”

	Faye shakes her head, shooting up and walking over to the wine bottle to take a long swig.
	
	“Sydero, that forest isn’t some random forest filled with lackadaisical faeries. The rumor is that Queen Titania is in there.” Sydero’s eyes widen at the words, realization hitting her.
	
	“That would’ve been important information, Faye!”
	
	“I would’ve told you if I knew what you were planning.”
	
	“Fuck! They’re lucky I need those faeries, and we need Chris to figure out who this man is.” Faye raises a brow. She wanted to question Sydero but felt it would be no use. Of course, Sydero would care more for her personal reasons than actually saving two lives. Faye actually would be more shocked if it were the other way around. The Sydero she knew would never place her life on the line for anyone, well there was an exception to that. But Faye made sure she never brought it up, it was always a touchy conversation with the woman.

	Faye grabs her keys, fighting herself not to get a second gulp of wine. She would probably finish the rest of the bottle by the end of the night. The two of them rush out of the house, hopefully in time to reach $name and Chris.

	“I sent $him faerie hunting.” The color drains from Faye’s face, and despite being mid-sip, her throat goes dry.

“Sydero, that forest isn’t some random forest filled with lackadaisical faeries.”
	
“Careful not to choke on these big words of yours.”

“Syd! That forest is rumored to harbor Queen Titania and her followers.” Sydero’s eyes widen at the words, realization hitting her.

“That would’ve been important information, Faye!”
	
“I would’ve told you if I knew what you were planning.”

“Fuck! Roe’s lucky I need those faeries, and we need $him to figure out who this man is.” Faye raises a brow. She wanted to question Sydero but felt it would be no use. Of course, Sydero would care more for her personal reasons than actually saving a life. Faye actually would be more shocked if it were the other way around. The Sydero she knew would never place her life on the line for anyone, well there was an exception to that. But Faye made sure she never brought it up, it was always a touchy conversation with the woman.

Faye grabs her keys, fighting herself not to get a second gulp of wine. She would probably finish the rest of the bottle by the end of the night. The two of them rush out of the house, hopefully in time to reach $name.

My eyes open to another section of the forest. A large oak tree rests in the middle of an otherwise large clearing. There are a few flowers around it but other than that, nothing. The size of the oak tree makes me ponder why they didn’t just call the forest Oak Forest or something, I suppose there was a lack of creativity to that.

I attempt to move but can’t move any muscle. I felt as if everything was numb but in a relaxed way. It was hard to explain, but I felt as if I was at a spa and the masseuse had done such a good job that I didn’t have feeling anywhere. I can still speak and blink, my head can still turn, so it was just everything below the neck like I thought.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“Chris, you awake?” I question, and he grunts from the other side of the tree we were tied up near.
	
	“Please tell me you can move.”
	
	“Nope. I can’t move anything besides my head. Do you see anything on your side?”
	
	“Nothing but trees and more trees. Oh, and a squirrel.” I roll my eyes but still hear his next words.
	
	“Are we going to die here?”

	“We don’t even know what’s going on.”

But perhaps there was some truth to it. Sydero did say that all fairytales had a bit of truth to them.

	I take a deep breath and open my eyes. My vision is fuzzy, as if the entire forest was now blurry. But it begins to clear up, and I start to see figures appearing.

She kept saying that death could come quickly, but I didn’t think it would be this soon. This was probably my fifth panic attack in a week. And the way my week was going, if I lived, I would have plenty more.

	“$name? Chris?” Faye calls out, pausing to see if she would get a reply. Her response was a bird chirping and what she presumed were two squirrels fighting. She begins to shout again when she looks over at Sydero, who casually glances around. She reminded her of a kid who had never been in a forest before.

	“Do you think you want to help with finding them?”
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\

	“Do you think you want to help find $him?”
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

Sydero approaches a rock, flipping it over with her foot, “no Roe here.”

“You’re unbelievable, you know that?” Sydero chose not to answer, believing it would be better not to put Faye on her lecture rant. Instead, she continues to look around, smelling lavender in the air. She follows her nose to an oak tree where an empty bowl sits and half-eaten fruit. Faye walks to the candles, licking her fingers before extinguishing the small flames.

“Do you hear that?” she asks, hearing the twinkling that flows on the breeze.

“You?”

“No, the shimmering. A faerie?” The two grow quiet, and once again the sound appears. It was rhythmic, as if belonging to a sleeping creature. Sydero is the first to move, following her ears to the noise and finding the culprit. A female faerie lays there, appearing almost drunk due to her sleeping position, and the fact that she hadn’t moved too far away.

“Faye, go get a jar.”

“Syd, we have bigger issues right now.” Sydero turns, daring Faye’s next actions. She stayed where she was before caving in. Faye always told herself that she shouldn’t ever get attached to people, it was all too easy for them to end up dead the next day. Sydero watches as she goes, slowly stepping away from the bush and faerie while she waited.

Suddenly, a loud shout carries itself through the forest, upsetting the peaceful aura that the forest was known for. Sydero casually rolls her eyes, that was definitely Roe.
&lt;&lt;if $SRomance &gt;= 1&gt;&gt;\

	A smirk appears, as she wonders if that’s what $he would sound like in bed. She would have to tease $him with the idea later.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

[[Continue-&gt;C3_2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="468" name="C3_2" tags="" position="3728,1699" size="100,100">Consequently, the shout awoke the faerie, and Faye still wasn’t back. Sydero gazes around for anything that could hold it when suddenly it flies out, screeching to a halt upon seeing her. Realization hits it, and it turns to fly off, freezing and then slamming to the ground. Sydero clenches her fist tighter as the creature wheezes, desperately trying to free itself from whatever was happening.

“Shut up,” she growls, feeling her body grow weaker.

Faye sprints back, her eyes nervously moving to a sweating Sydero and then to a panicked faerie. She quickly scoops the faerie up and secures the top. Sydero releases her fist, trudging over to a tree after taking the jar with the furious faerie in her arms.

“Also, Roe is that way. I heard $him scream,” she told her antsy companion.

“Are you sure you’re going to make it?” Sydero growls in warning, waving the worry away, “let’s go then.” Faye takes off, leaving Sydero who hasn’t yet moved. Her head gently hits the trunk of the tree, the world spinning a tad bit to fast for her. But she needed to go. With all of her remaining energy, she walked in the direction Faye ran off.

&lt;&lt;link [img[images/divider.png]] &gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/link&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $faeriesight&gt;&gt;\
	I watch with concern as the faeries place groups of beautiful white and pink flowers around me, and then delicately place what looks to be shiny blackberries on top of them. I knew what blackberries looked like, and these were much too big and much too shiny to be that.
	
	The two faeries glance up at me and then giggle like little children, prancing off.
	
	&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
		“Hey, $name, what are you seeing?” I roll my eyes at his question. If he only would listen to me, then he wouldn’t need to ask me that every two seconds.
		
		“What about you start believing,” I say back.
		
		“Whatever, Peter Pan, I already tried.”
		
		“Try harder.”
	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	I watch with concern as groups of beautiful white and pink flowers are placed around me by an invisible force. And then, what looks to be shiny blackberries are placed on top of them. I knew what blackberries looked like, and these were much too big and much to shiny to be that.
	
	I hear sonorous shimmering before it drifts away.

		“This is some real creepy shit. I swear I’m high,” Chris says. There was no way he wasn’t a believer now. Whether these were faeries or not, something supernatural was definitely going on.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“You heard that, right?” I ask Chris who huffs as his way of saying yes.

	&quot;$name? Chris? Are you two okay?&quot; I hear Faye whisper from the bush. Relief floods over me when I realize it’s her. So, they did come after us, I had begun to doubt them.
	
	&lt;&lt;if $faeriesight&gt;&gt;\
		&quot;Sure, getting tied up by some invisible force is everyone&#39;s dream, right?&quot; Chris questions sarcastically.

		&quot;You mean you can&#39;t see the faeries? You still don&#39;t believe?&quot;

		“I believe,” I correct her, “and I see them. But Chris still has issues.”

		&quot;Tinkerbell doesn’t exist,&quot; he states stubbornly.

		“One of these days you’re going to have to face the truth,” I tell him.
	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
		&quot;Sure, getting tied up by some invisible force is everyone&#39;s dream, right?&quot; I question sarcastically.

		&quot;Seriously?&quot; Chris barks in annoyance, &quot;to see Tinkerbell we have to believe!&quot;

		“You guys didn’t realize that?” she questions, and though I can’t see Chris’s face, I’m pretty sure we’re both staring at her unamused.
	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	&quot;$name? Are you okay?&quot; I hear Faye call out. Relief floods over me when I realize it’s her. So, they did come after me, I had begun to doubt them.

	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
		
She creeps closer to me, sorting through the plants and then at the ropes that bind me.

“I’ll have you –,” she begins to say before her body is launched into the air. She lands on a low hanging branch, and she struggles to move but fails. 

&lt;&lt;if $faeriesight&gt;&gt;\
	The faeries gather around, laughing up at her.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	I hear a group of shimmering strike up, and I close my eyes. I need to start believing, or there was no way I was getting out of this. It wasn’t hard to become a believer. When I reopen my eyes, everything is blurry. The forest is the first to straighten up, but I begin to see figures. The longer I look at them, the more they materialize until I see a large crowd of faeries. Some were in their actual form, flying about. While others were human size, and like Sydero had said, all gorgeous and ethereal appearing. Not just that, but the clearing wasn&#39;t so clear anymore. Bright huts of varying sizes litter the clearing, an impressive town. Bridges going from one tree to another rest overhead, and I even see a town square closer to the oak tree.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“Aw shit, I see them. Aw shit, aw shit,” Chris states, repeating it again and again.

	“Let me down!” Faye shouts and the faeries laugh at this. One of them approaches me, her delicate hand taking my chin harshly into her grip.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

&lt;&lt;if $faeriesight&gt;&gt;\
	“Your choice cutie, your friend first or you?”
	
	“For what?” She doesn’t answer, she just laughs and retreats away from me.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“It’s about time you see us. Ignorance is bliss, huh? Consider yourself lucky, mortals rarely ever look upon us,” a female faerie points out, glaring at me, unimpressed.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“So, why can’t I move?” I question, and another woman speaks up. Actually, they were all women, I couldn’t see one man among them.

&lt;&lt;if $int is &quot;women&quot; or $int is &quot;both&quot;&gt;&gt;\
	On any other day, this would be paradise for me. So many beautiful women in one place. But that paradise lacked the part where they kidnap me for anything less than a good time.
	&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	
		“This would be such a nice thing if they weren’t planning something horrible,” Chris complains, putting my thoughts into words.
	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“We charmed you, can’t have you getting away,” this one giggles. They all had a case of the giggles, I suspect.

“Stop teasing them,” I hear a booming voice announce. The entire area quiets down, the forest along with it. I spot a bright glowing orb make its way down a wide trail. As it gets closer, each faerie takes a knee, bowing their head in respect. Suddenly the bright glow seems to explode, leaving bright colored dust to fall around the woman who now stands there.

[[Continue-&gt;C3_4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="470" name="C3_4" tags="" position="3935,1700" size="100,100">Faerie queen was written all over her. She had long blonde hair that reached the ground, brightly colored flowers resting randomly amongst it. Her eyes were a bright blue and each time she opened her mouth, it was like nature took a deep, relieved breath. But the thing that drew my eye mostly was her nude body. Besides a thick white veil, nothing else covered her, and her body was on display for all of us to see. Her tan skin glimmered under the sun, as if someone had poured just the right amount of golden glitter all over her.

	I hear Chris let out a long appreciating whistle and I wish I were near him, if only to kick him.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“Queen Titania,” I hear Faye whisper in fear from overhead. At the mention of her name, her eyes turn to us, and she makes her way over. Beautiful wildflowers appear where she steps, and if she happens to step on dirt, grass immediately appears to cushion her step instead. This entire forest treasured and loved this woman.

“Indeed. I am Titania, Queen of the faeries.” Her words felt like whispers upon the skin, a soft and much-needed wind on an otherwise scorching hot day. I shiver, part of me wishing for her to say something else.

“What are your names?”

[[Tell her your name.]]

	“$name,” I tell her, hoping to stay on her good side. Her eyes move to Faye, and she answers as well, finally to Chris who seems far too ready to say his name, even more than me.
			
	“Welcome, $name, Faye, and Chris to today’s ritual. You are our esteemed guests. And unless you have someone else, we shall start now.” Faye is lifted from the tree by one of the only male faeries I’ve seen thus far and is placed right next to me.

“Where’s Syd?” I question, hoping no one heard me. Faye shrugs her shoulders, obviously not knowing where she was and fearing that she had run off.

We needed to buy ourselves time, and they didn’t know where Sydero was either. This way, they would halt the ritual until later.
		
“We can still begin now,” Queen Titania chuckles, turning around to direct her faeries. Well, that plan failed.

“A ritual to replenish our forests and our magic,” her eyes narrow on me with glee, “a ritual that calls for human sacrifices.”
		
&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“Of course, those are the best kinds,” I hear Chris say. He says so in a joking manner, but every word was spoken in pure fear.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“Faeries get their magic from mortals?” Faye asks next.
		
“We get our energy from your souls; any soul would do, but humans have a certain ... rawness and purity to theirs. We find that it gives us the most energy, so are innocent souls.”

“And you said you have no idea where Syd is?” I question again, trying to fidget in my bonds but I still had no feeling in my body.

“Last I saw her she was ...” Faye trails off, her face falling as whatever she says catches up to her.

“What? You last saw her what?”

“She was out of it, almost out of energy. She was leaning on a tree and I ... I didn’t know if she was going to make it.” I nod, realizing what this meant. Sydero might have passed out somewhere, and we were about to be sacrificed for a forest. My mind goes back to the beauty that the forest held, and I wonder how many souls it took for it to get there. I think about all forests and if this is why some forests burn, while others see centuries of life. How much did the supernatural world affect our world, the world that knew little to nothing of the supernatural?

&lt;&lt;if $cp is false&gt;&gt;\
	I watch as a faerie puts down the last flower and approaches the queen. She performs a dainty bow before springing back up happily. “We are done, my queen. We can begin.” Titania smiles and her eyes move to rest on us.
	
	“That one,” she says, pointing at me, “$he goes first.”
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“Hey, $name,” I hear Chris say quietly.
	
	“What?”

		“What I said earlier, I’m sorry. I made it seem like your parent’s, and uncle’s death was all your fault. I know it’s not, I know you didn’t ask for this. I’m just scared. I’m scared that I’ll never see my parents again and that they’ll think something bad happened. It’s not easy, tossing your life away, everything you ever worked for.”

	“You’re right. I guess I just got mad because I’m freaking out, yet you seem so calm, even if you aren’t. I don’t blame you. This is my fault, I kept pushing you, and I put myself in this. I know, I’m just trying to say sorry.”

	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
	
	I’m unable to say more as I watch a faerie put down the last flower and approach the queen. She performs a dainty bow before springing back up happily. “We are done, my queen. We can begin.” Titania smiles and her eyes move to rest on us.

“Hold on,” I screech, moving my head from side to side since my body still refused to respond. //Taken out by faeries// was not something I want to be engraved on my tombstone.

“Faye, help! Do something,” I shout to her as if she could actually do something to aid me. The wild look that Faye gives me proves that there wasn’t anything she could do. She thrusts from side to side in her own bounds, each thrust yielding nothing.

The faeries drag me over to the flowers that they had arranged like a bed. Others begin to beat drums and play flutes, their song was merry and in my own personal opinion, not a wise one to play. In Titania’s hands rests a blade with thorny vines wrapped around it. If only I had my own blade, perhaps it would be wise to keep it on my person if I do get out of this.

They stop me at the bed, Titania raising her hands to cease all talking and noise. The entire air seems to stand still at her command.

“Today,” she calls out, even I rest on edge, curious to hear her next words, “we renew our forests and our spirits. Today we cleanse ourselves and start anew. Begin the –” The silence is interrupted by the sound of someone clapping. I turn my head as much as I can, getting a glimpse of Sydero on the clearing’s outskirts. Tucked safely in the crook of her arm is a jar with a faerie inside. And I’m not the only one who takes notice.

“Sister,” Titania says, her eyes practically popping out of her head as she looks at Sydero in pure hatred, “you dare trap my kind in such manner?”

Sydero looks down at the jar with a puzzled expression, “well, yea.”

“Let her go,” she orders and each faerie takes a threatening step towards her.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“You first. I want all three of them, for her.”
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“You first. I want both of them, for her.” 
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

Titania takes a step closer to me, raising that blade of hers to my neck.

[[“Uh, can you move that away?”]]
[[“Maybe try being nice, Syd.”]]
[[“Is this really necessary?”]]
[[“There’s no way I’m surviving this.”]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="478" name="“Uh, can you move that away?”" tags="" position="4084,1907" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
“Uh, can you maybe move that away from my neck?” Titania looks at me, confused how one minute I was on the path to peeing myself, and now I have suddenly found my voice. A moment ago, I thought I was doomed, Sydero’s appearance has since changed my mind.

“So, what will it be?”

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“You ask me to give the souls of three, for the life of one?”
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“You ask me to give the souls of two, for the life of one?”
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“Not just anyone, your sister, your kind. But if it’s no deal, then I can’t blame you, I’ll just take her with me,” Sydero turns around, and before she can even take a step, Titania orders her to stop. She gives Sydero a skeptical look, smirking afterward.

“Or perhaps I’ll take you all? Though I can’t find much use for you,” Titania drifts off, looking Sydero over before her eyes widen. Whether it was due to whatever she was about to say, or because Sydero begins to violently shake the jar up and down, I don’t know. The faerie inside jostles up and down violently. Each time she makes contact with the top or bottom of the jar, a quick thump is heard.

“All of these suggestions are great. But I’m only looking for a yes to one.”

“Stop. Stop hurting her.”

“Wait, this hurts her? See, I was trying to figure out ways to do that, all I came up with is this.” Sydero moves the jar from side to side quickly, the faerie violently slapping each side of the container. She falls to the ground, appearing weak and injured.

“Stop, and I’ll give you your friends.” Sydero taps the side of her chin with her free hand, throwing the jar up and down with her free one.

“Deal.”

“After you let our fellow sister go.”

Sydero chuckles, “that’s not how this works. Let them go, and you can get your darling little faerie back. Oh, and make sure to uncharm them, it’s rude to return something in a broken state when that’s not how it came.” Titania snaps her fingers, and I can feel my body.

“You are a horrible host, and this entire party, trash. I’ve seen fifth-grade birthday parties with more decorum than you. Put some damn clothes on too, and pick up your glittery crap that keeps falling everywhere.” I can feel her eyes glaring at me as I walk off, continuing to rant about my time here in the Honeycutt Forest.
		
“Got that all out of your system?” Sydero asks with a wide smirk, and I nod.

Once we are all by her side, Titania clears her throat, “be truthful to your word.”

“Of course,” Sydero smirks and flings the jar towards Titania who barely catches it. She begins to release the faerie, but that’s all I’m able to see before I’m being dragged away.

“Do not let them escape,” I hear the Queen of the Forest scream behind us, each of us pick up our pace as we go. I run behind Sydero, following her closely since she and Faye would know which way to go, hopefully. Suddenly I spot large white clumps, scattered all across the ground.

I shake my hands out and then turn to Queen Titania, swiftly slapping her clean across the face. The faeries gasp and growl as they turn their ire to me, but Sydero reminds them how vital one life is. I quickly walk to Sydero’s side, feeling the glare of the queen the entire time.

“It’s salt, now come on,” Sydero growls, pulling me behind her.
		
“Why salt?”
		
“Faeries and some other creatures have some weird obsession with it. They can’t help but count each individual piece when they find it.”
		
“Smart,” I hear Faye yell back at her.

Once on the road, I take a few deep breaths, thinking back on the day. I was just happy I survived. One question bugs me though, and even though I was going to allow this ride to be silent, I wish to ask it.

“You said humans choose this type of lifestyle, why? Seems like everything can kill and take advantage of us, and we can’t do anything.”
&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	
	I see Chris perk up, interested in the answer to I suppose.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

Sydero is silent the first few minutes, if I had a shorter attention span, then I would no longer care.

Finally, she turns to look at me, “I ask myself the same question. Why?” She places her eyes back on the road and continues to follow behind Faye.

When we get back to Faye’s place, I immediately head towards the shower, savoring the hot water as it strikes my skin. For the first time in a long time, my mind is blank. Even as I try to think of things, I fail. My mind refuses to do anything but relax, to wash away the day, the week. Once the shower comes to an end, I go to the mirror, taking a look at my reflection.

&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
There was no way I was going to stop, I didn’t care enough and I sure as hell wasn’t about to risk my life for some mysterious white stuff. I keep going, telling myself that I’ll ask later. I just want to be out of this forest.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	Once we all get to the cars, Chris is the first inside, crumpling onto the backseat in exhaustion.
	
	“You mind driving?” I ask Sydero, tossing her the keys, “I have a headache.”

	“You mind driving?” I ask Sydero, tossing her the keys, “I have a headache.”
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

Once on the road, I take a few deep breaths, thinking back on the day. I was just happy I survived. One question bugs me though, and even though I was going to allow this ride to be silent, I wish to ask it.

“You said humans choose this type of lifestyle, why? Seems like everything can kill and take advantage of us, and we can’t do anything.”
&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\

	I see Chris perk up, interested in the answer too.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

Sydero is silent the first few minutes, if I had a shorter attention span, then I would no longer care.

Finally, she turns to look at me, “I ask myself the same question. Why?” She places her eyes back on the road and continues to follow behind Faye.

When we get back to Faye’s place, I immediately head towards the shower, savoring the hot water as it strikes my skin. For the first time in a long time, my mind is blank. Even as I try to think of things, I fail. My mind refuses to do anything but relax, to wash away the day, the week. Once the shower comes to an end, I go to the mirror, taking a look at my reflection.

&lt;&lt;if $hairlength is &quot;bald&quot;&gt;&gt;\
	I run my hands over my head. After a while, I was no longer staring at my lack of hair. I was staring at me. Staring at who I was becoming, and who I still have yet to become. This was only the beginning, Sydero had told me that this morning.

I would miss this. Knowing Sydero, we would be back living in abandoned homes and trying to figure out what to eat in no time. The thought makes me cringe, maybe I should start persuading her on the idea of motels.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	I open the door, running straight into Chris who’s standing on the other side. We stare at one another. I fail to say anything because I had nothing to say, while Chris seems like he had everything to say.

	“Can we talk?” he finally asks, I shrug, “look, that stuff I said earlier ...”
	
	“You already apologized, remember?”
	
	“Yea no, that was horrible, and I did the stupid thing and said it when I thought I was going to die.

“Boy, do you have a problem,” she chuckles nervously, taking yet another swig.

“Don’t you dare ruin me by saying he’s real. Is that all you know about this man?”

“Pretty much, he rules over thirty legions in hell, his symbol is a crow. The books don’t really give me up to date knowledge, Sydero. They’re books ... but there is someone who can help.” Both women look at one another and in unison say the name, “Bradley.”

Faye relaxes an inch more, “I’m guessing you know where he is?”

“Yea. Unless he ran off, which I doubt. I should visit him anyway, knowing him he hasn’t been out of his hole since the last time I dragged him out,” Sydero stands and bids the rest of us goodnight, retiring for the night.

Faye made her rounds, checking to see if everyone was sound asleep, well everyone but Sydero. Her stomach twists as she thinks about what she was about to do. It was for the greater good, or so that was what she told herself. And she supposes it was true, not just some lie she told herself to sleep better at night. At least this way, Sydero wouldn’t ... Faye shudders at the thought. She’d rather just get this over with.

She enters the attic where Sydero is, finishing her task of lighting four white candles. Faye watches her for a second before turning her attention to the three faeries that Sydero had managed to capture. Each were males, their presence spoke volumes about why male faeries were so rare. They weren’t as smart as their female counterparts and consequently were kept around purely for reproduction reasons.

In each jar rests a sweet pea, a scent that faeries couldn’t get enough of and put them in an almost drunken state. This state was bordering unconsciousness, since even while drunk, faeries could react to their environment.

“Are you ready?” Faye questions, her hands shaking. Sydero raises a brow but says nothing, nodding so that they could get on with this. Faye takes a deep breath in and opens the first jar, as Sydero places a bowl in front of her. She removes the faerie and puts the comatose being inside.

“Bless this body,” she begins and pours water into the bowl, “bless this mind.” Next, she pours a third of the bottle of peppermint oil. “And bless this soul for the one whose blood commands complete control.” Sydero offers her hand towards Faye, and she takes it, with a blade she slices her palm, angling it down so that it dripped onto the faerie.

“Remember to keep it open,” Faye reminds her.

“With this blessed body, blessed mind, and blessed soul – we bid for the energy within.” The candle&#39;s flame grows tremendously, threatening to eat away the candle. The faerie’s body grows blue and white, the colors demanding to be set free.

“You gonna do it, or will I?” It really wasn’t a question, there was a reason this ritual needed two people. Faye carefully placed the tip of the knife on the faerie and slid it down, allowing the white and blue essence to escape its host&#39;s body. The faerie was so out of it that it couldn&#39;t even register the pain, the act of being cut open. Faye could only pray that such a death was without pain and was quick. The mixture swims around, mixing itself with the other contents of the bowl until all of it turned black.

I open the book and decide to actually read everything I come across, starting from the beginning. Today has taught me that life was unpredictable. I believed I would be dealing with a shapeshifter and werewolf mainly, but I was kidnapped by faeries and being chased by a demon. I would need a considerable amount of knowledge for every creature, because who knows when it would come in handy.
		
I get particularly far in the book, starting from page five and ending up on page twenty when everything goes dark, and my heartbeat steadies.

The house situates itself before growing quiet. I can’t hear the tiniest bit of movement as I sit there, and I wonder if I reveled in this silence or despised it secretly. Tomorrow we would be back on the road, again doing who knows what.
	
A demon, we had a demon chasing us. But why? Well, I suppose the question was partially silly, I knew why. I got in his way, more than once. But the reason he was after Sydero was unknown, I doubt even she knew. I recall her saying something about taking something of theirs but that was vague, she could be alluding to anything.
		
I sigh in defeat, I had told myself to keep a clear mind, to enjoy the silence that resided not only around me but also in my mind. Yet here I was, thinking and fretting of the future.
		
I finished my drink before leaving to go to sleep. If this trend continues then my dreams should be empty. For the first time in a long time, I was looking forward to sleeping.

With no essence, the body would decompose into soil. Soil that makes for great fertilizer. She turns to Sydero who pours the liquid into a bottle, drinking it a minute later. She recoils as soon as the liquid touches her tongue, but she continues on, swallowing all of it.

Sydero’s amber eyes grew to a golden color, one that radiated power. A grey mist formed across her body, making the smirk that Sydero wore seem five times eviler.

“I hate the taste, but I love the feeling,” she growls, shivering as the feeling of raw power spreads throughout her body.

“Perhaps we should start looking into alternatives. One that doesn’t require capturing and devouring a supernatural creature’s essence,” Faye points out nervously. She takes a cautious step back, remembering what happened last time Sydero had done this.

“We already been through this, there are no alternatives. We either do this, or the real beast gets to come out and play.”

“I know,” Faye begins, “but ...” She understood why they did this, why they had to, despite her worries. And as Sydero said, this was the best alternative, it wasn’t as if they hadn’t tried others. That was how they met, Faye was her last hope. For years she has gone through her books, her spells, and called upon others. There was nothing else.

She gazes over at the young woman, sighing deeply, “two more to go.”

	The next day, I place the bags in the trunk and then each of our individual bags in the backseat on the floor. Faye was a more than gracious host, giving us whatever she could spare. We each now had a backpack for our personal things.
	
	&lt;&lt;if $aptstuff&gt;&gt;\
		I had my laptop and some other things from my apartment thanks to Chris, but Chris was still missing a great deal of his stuff. When he came down to see me, he wasn’t planning on staying. Sydero was fine with what she had, I suppose if she had needed anything then she would’ve taken the initiative and gotten it by now.
	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
		I didn’t have anything from my apartment, and so Faye gave me a spare laptop that she never uses, it wasn’t the newest, but it would do whatever I needed it to do. She also spared some money, telling us all to go get more clothes. Neither Chris nor I had a large wardrobe now, and Sydero could always use more clothes.

I look over at the two women, they were speaking low enough to where I couldn’t hear them. But I could tell that Faye was harping, and Sydero was behaving like an insolent child. Sydero was looking much better than yesterday and the day before that. I was left out of the loop on why that was, but I was left out on a lot of things.

It was one of the reasons our relationship was so rocky, with no sign of getting better.

“Doesn’t seem like she needs me for that,” I tell Faye, walking towards the ready to go car.

“That’s not what I meant.” I stop and turn to see Faye giving me a worried look. My brow creases in confusion, but I don’t ask her to elaborate as I get into the car. I keep my eye on Faye as she wraps her arms around herself, seeing us off.

&lt;&lt;link [img[images/divider.png]] &gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/link&gt;&gt;
“How many werewolves did we kill?” Syd questions, going further into Bradley’s room.

“Three,” I answer, finding the room a mess.

“And the woman said she remembers seeing five or six.”

&lt;&lt;link [img[images/divider.png]] &gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/link&gt;&gt;

	“So, how far do we have left to go?” Chris questions, asking the question that was on all of our minds. We’ve been stuck in the car for four hours straight, each of us driving for an hour before switching with the other. 
	
	Though, Chris and I both agreed collectively that Sydero’s driving was a health hazard. A distance that should’ve taken an hour ended up taking only thirty minutes.

	Persuading Sydero to actually stop at a diner was a feat in itself, one that took teamwork and just the right amount of annoyance. The longer we talked, the more Sydero wanted to pull over. That, and she wasn’t exactly impressed with my road trip playlist.
	
	As we wait for our food, the conversation drifts from one insignificant topic to the next. For a group dying to know more about one another, we were doing the opposite. 
	
	“So, Sydero,” Chris begins, his eyes leaving a waitress who walks by our table, “got anyone special?”
	
	“I don’t do relationships,” she answers plainly.
	
	“Why’s that?” I roll my eyes involuntarily, already knowing what she was going to say. The topic brought up the conversation that we had engaged in at Faye’s house. The issue of love being a weakness, not a strength. And sure enough, she says it.

	&lt;&lt;if $CRomance &gt;= 1&gt;&gt;\
		“So, you’ve never loved anyone?” Chris continues to ask. Sydero shakes her head, leaning in as her glance moves from Chris to me.
		
		“And what about you two? You guys ever hook up?” Chris chokes on what I thought was his drink, but it turns out that the question had just shocked him. His reaction compared to my subtle blush was all Sydero needed for an answer.
		
		&lt;&lt;if $gender is &quot;male&quot; or $gender is &quot;trans-male&quot; or $gender is &quot;non-binary&quot;&gt;&gt;\
			“Oh, I’m straight,” Chris chuckles, amused at the idea that he could be anything but.
			
			“Uh huh,” Sydero says, and I feel the weight of her gaze. Once I finally look towards her, she raises a curious brow. Whether Chris could see it, and understand its meaning, I knew exactly what she was thinking and concluding in her mind.
		&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
			“We’re just really close friends,” Chris states nervously, rubbing the back of his neck.
			
			“So, you never thought, not even for a minute?” she questions, asking both of us but more so to Chris. I didn’t know if she was doing this just to mess with Chris, or if she was truly curious about the lack of a sexual relationship between us.

			“No,” we both say at the same time. But unlike Chris’s affirmative no, mine was laced with regret. Sydero might not be much of a people person, but her ability to pick up on even the smallest cues was extraordinary. 
			
			As soon as the no leaves my mouth, her eyes move to me, and the glimmer that rests there tells me she heard the regret loud and clearly.
		&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
	
		Thankfully our food comes, causing Sydero and Chris to forget about the entire thing, lucky for them, for my mind still drifts on the words that had been said.
	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
		Thankfully our food comes, ending the conversation there.
	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
	
	We eat quietly, only speaking to speak about our food and the atmosphere of the diner. Sydero wears a subtle grin as she devours her burger, and Chris finally seems relaxed.

“What do you do?” I question, a sarcastic tone to my question.

She shrugs nonchalantly, “I’ve had one-night stands here and there. Mainly, I just stay to myself.” She raises a brow and shoots me a smirk, leaning forward as if preparing to tell me a secret. “And how about you, Roe? Who ... or what, did you leave behind?”

It was simple and straight-forward, one of those I knew Syd would appreciate more than me just implying it.

	“Sure, whatever,” she states briefly, taking another bite of her burger. I blink a couple of times, replaying her words in my head for good measure. She had agreed. And here I had a whole five-minute proposal planned on why it would be better. I almost wanted to still give it.

	“Just like that?” I question.

	“Are you being sarcastic right now?” Chris asks next.

	“No. A motel is a better setup, my safehouses only really accommodate one person. But if we’re going to do motels, then we have to start being smart with our money and doing more jobs. Though I’m not looking for any classy motels so don’t go thinking we’re about to be living lavishly.” I nod, the worst motel I’ve ever seen still would beat her safehouses easily in an accommodating competition.

“Can you be more specific?” she inquires before taking another bite of her burger.
			
“Well, you said that supernatural creatures are usually specialists, why is that?”

“To be honest, it’s because they didn’t want to call themselves hunters and put themselves in a category with humans, humans agreed. Supernatural creatures hunting and killing supernatural creatures because they kill, well it makes us seem like hypocrites to humans. Most humans use that as an excuse to kill supernatural specialists.”

“Have they ever come after you?” I question.

“A few of them have tried, even some specialists have with kill contracts. But I’m not the easiest to get rid of,” she shrugs, not caring to hide the cockiness in her tone, “most are smart enough to just not fuck with me.”

“So Syd,” I begin, thinking about the faeries that almost made me into a forest sacrifice. I wonder what would have been done with my soul, would I have become part of the forest, or was I just fuel for all those living within? “You needed us to attract a faerie for you, and it didn’t exactly work out. What were your plans?”

“For me to know, and you to find out,” she yawns, before taking another bite of her burger. She sends me a warning glare, one that I didn’t heed for obvious reasons.

“Why is it so hard to answer a simple question for you?”

“Why are you always trying to get in //my// business?”

“Same reason why you always get into my business.”

“Reality check, Roe, I couldn’t give two fucks about your life and what you do. I don’t question you unless it’s putting my life on the line.”

“For all I know your answer to this question could put my life on the line.” What she does next, causes me more worry. A flicker of doubt and pondering crosses her features, as if I had a point with my statement. It’s there for only a minute before disappearing, and she continues to eat in silence. I hadn’t been serious, I had just thought to add the words to better deliver my point. Could my life seriously be in danger because of something she did? But she had failed, she had let the faerie go to save us. The thought gives me little comfort.

“Perhaps when I’m not struggling every day. We’ll need our money for food, gas, and probably a lot of other stuff. A specialist’s life isn’t really the wealthiest. So, do what you want.” With that, she walks out.

“You two were,” she asks, but I shake my head before she can finish.

“He never knew how I felt about him, I never thought it was the right time.” She snorts and even laughs at the glare that I give her.
	
“There’s no such thing as a right time. Tomorrow you can die, and you end up dying with regrets, all because you were scared.”
					
“I never said I was scared,” I growl, and this causes her to laugh even louder.
					
“Oh please, anyone who uses that shitty excuse is scared. If you weren’t then you’d understand that there’s no right time. There’s when you do it, and when you don’t do it.” Over the past week, if I learned nothing else about Sydero, I learned that she is stubborn. So, this argument or discussion wasn’t going anywhere.

&#39;&#39;Somewhere unknown ...&#39;&#39;

The sound of multiple steps echoing off pavement pushes the woman to run faster. Her breathing was shallow, and she was sure she’d suffer a heart attack soon. She rounds a corner, whimpering when she finds it to be an alleyway, one that led further into the darkness. She didn’t have time to curse herself, she needed to hide.

She spots a large garbage can and dives behind it. Her hand coming to rest on something both slimy and limp, something that was emanating a nauseating odor. She holds her breath, refusing to let such a thing give away her hiding spot, even if it felt like it had just moved. Suddenly, her eyes widen in acknowledgment, feeling the hard device push up against her right thigh. Her phone, she still had her phone.

She dialed the three-digit number, never so happy to hear a man’s voice.

“911, what is your emergency?”

“Please help me,” she hisses into the phone, trying to speak as clearly yet quietly as she knew how. “There’s a group of people following me.”

“Do you know where you are, ma’am? Near any restaurants or stores?”

“No,” she cries, hot tears running down her eyes, “I’m in an alleyway, and I’m scared to leave.”

“I need you to find the street address or a lighted building that you can go into, get off the streets.”

“I’m going to find the address.” She didn’t do so immediately, panic causing her entire body to lockup and resist the order her brain sends out. Finally, she stands to full height. Staring at the end of the alleyway. She couldn’t hear anyone but the dispatcher, perhaps she had lost them. 

She inches out when suddenly she catches sight of a blur. The blurry mass pushes her harshly into the wall, her phone dropping from her hands. She prepares to scream when a large hand grabs her neck, squeezing it as a warning.

“Don’t kill me please,” she whimpers, snot and tears mixing together as the woman was held in place, praying to a god that she had lost faith in.

“Shh,” the figure says softly, softly pushing her hair out of her face. Every act made her jump, made her wish she was luckier, someone else, someplace else. The finger moves down the surface of her face, inching towards her neck, and then lower. Her mind went to a dark place, a place that had the nerve to compare the better of two crimes. One which stole her dignity and another that stole her life. She could only wail, refusing to let her mind continue down a path darker than the alleyway she was currently standing in.

The finger proceeds to travel, and though her eyes were shut closed, she could hear others approaching. The finger stops at her heart, before removing itself. The hand around her neck slackens next. She was free, she thought. 

She opens an eye when pain radiates through her body. A pain that was foreign to her. The pain of death being only feet away, ready to claim her soul. Her scream echoes down the alleyway, and no amount of thrashing or fighting against her attacker helped her. Instincts take over, her body realizing the situation, and doing everything it could to live, to survive. It was a fight that she had no chance of winning.

I pull the car to a stop, earnestly hoping that Sydero would insult me for my inability to take directions. That would mean that this was the wrong place. When Sydero doesn’t tease me or even insult me, I know I’m wrong. She gets out, walking towards the lone house in confidence.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	&quot;What is up with all of you living out in abandoned houses?&quot; I question. At least Sydero picked houses in neighborhoods, this house was in the middle of nowhere, an object that intermingled in with its surroundings. It looks as barren as the fields that it rests in. At least it didn’t hold the creepy element that Sydero’s houses did.

	&quot;Bradley was actually the one who gave me the idea to use abandoned places,&quot; Sydero pauses after her words, turning back towards us, &quot;be careful, Bradley likes to booby trap his stuff. He&#39;s paranoid like that.&quot;

She shrugs and kicks down the door with ease. Either the door was due to come down, or she was much stronger than she looked. The inside looks worse than the outside and made me take back my previous comment of the house not appearing creepy. 

The air was dank and stale, smelling twice as worse as the cleansing juice did which was saying something. Nothing should ever smell worse than that. I doubt breathing in this air was healthy, but Sydero walks through as if she didn’t mind. There was hardly any furniture, and the house was so decrepit that I could no longer tell what room was which. The walls were rotten enough to house an assortment of bugs. Parts of the ceiling had caved in, letting small bursts of light penetrate inside. This only further put the dust and dirt on display.
&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	
	“Is this what you were staying in?” Chris asks, appearing horrified by the idea.

	“No,” I reassure him, “Syd’s safehouses were habitable at least.”
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

There was no way someone was living here, alive anyhow. I wonder if zombies were real ...

“Ugh, I haven’t been here in forever,” I hear Sydero say, “spread out and look for something out of place. It’s here somewhere.” I’m unable to ask her what we were looking for as she goes upstairs, a death sentence frankly. Each step seems to cause the house to howl in protest. One of the steps she takes completely gives out.

I do what she asks though, especially if it means getting fresh air any time soon. She said to search for anything that seems out of place, a manageable task I assume.

[[Search the floor.]]

	We stare at him and he at us.
	
	“So, you come into my home and just choose to stare at me?” he asks.

	“Bradley,” Sydero states, coming into view. The boy’s eyes light up with recognition, and he further comes out. I didn’t expect much, Sydero hadn’t given me much information to form some sort of image. Yet, even with low expectations, the person in front of me still didn’t meet them. Bradley was a teenager, perhaps fifteen or sixteen. He was a wide, blue-eyed boy who held absolutely no kind of facial hair, and a head full of short curly brown hair.

	&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
		“This is Bradley?” Chris questions, done evaluating the boy, “this is a kid.”

		“Watch out, everyone, we got a genius amongst us,” Bradley says in mock fascination and surprise.
	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
		“So, you’re Bradley?” I ask, scratching the side of my head. I really was expecting a man. I was expecting anything but a kid.

		“Last time I checked, I was. My dream of waking up as Ryan Reynolds hasn’t happened yet.”
	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
	
	“Now, who was the one who rang for me?” he questions, and Sydero motions her head towards me. He turns to me and gives me a look. “Do you watch anime sub or dub?”
	
	[[“Sub.”]]
	[[“Dub.”]]
	[[“Depends.”]]
	[[“I don’t um, watch anime.”]]
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	Sydero hoists up the door, and we’re all met with the barrel of a shotgun.
	
	“Ugh, put that down, kid,” Sydero growls, throwing the trapdoor further back so that it slams onto the floor.
	
	“Sydero?” a voice asks, lowering the gun. The wielder comes out further. I didn’t expect much, Sydero hadn’t given me much information to form some sort of image. Yet, even with low expectations, the person in front of me still didn’t meet them. Bradley was a teenager, perhaps fifteen or sixteen.

	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
	
	He turns his attention to Sydero, “did you have to scare the shit out of me?”
	
	“Well, I couldn’t find whatever I needed to find, so I did it the hard way.”
	
	&lt;&lt;if $gastrap&gt;&gt;\
		He perks up, gazing past me and towards the wall where the gas was still coming from.

		“And you tripped one of the traps.” He stalks up to it, fiddling with the device and not showing any kind of heed for the gas that now surrounded him.

		“I’m guessing that gas is harmless, huh?” I question. Bradley nods, stopping it and turning to me.

		“It’s just colored smoke. It’s meant to come out faster than that and scare whoever’s here.”
	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
		“You do everything the hard way, come on,” he motions with his hand for us to follow him, marching back down the stairs into his hidden room.

The most exciting thing down here was the group of worms that were conjugating. There was nothing shiny, nothing that stood out. It was all crap.
		
&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	I turn to continue looking when I see Chris trip on nothing. Only, it turns out to be something, and a piece of the wall comes crashing down near him. I react instantly, yanking him back just in time to avoid the collapsing part of the wall.

	“I hate my life,” Chris whimpers. I help him up when Sydero sprints down, somehow avoiding all of the wrong steps.

	“What happened?” she asks but answers her own question when she sees the fallen wall. She rolls her eyes but doesn’t appear upset.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	Sydero comes down a minute later, somehow avoiding all of the wrong steps.
		
	“Find anything?” I ask, and she shakes her head, tapping her chin as she gazes around in thought. I watch as she stomps one foot, and then begins to jump. She pounds the ground, walking everywhere until I hear her stomp echo. She moves some debris out the way, and we find the outline of a trapdoor.

	“Found you, Bradley,” she states with a wide smirk, grabbing the edge of the door and pulling it up.

The wallpaper that once was there had given way to the wall that was also decomposing. I didn’t even know walls could do such a thing. Everything was different shades of brown, except one thing. I see something glistening there, pushed into the wall.

[[Grab it.]]

&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
I go into what I assume is the kitchen. There’s no refrigerator or counters, but there is a lone cabinet, barely clinging to the wall. The door of the cupboard has already given up the struggle, it rests in a broken heap on the floor. Resting alongside the fractured pile rests an oddly placed book. My eyes would’ve swept right over it, but one thing about it strikes me as strange. The book’s pages should be frayed, brown, and crinkled. 

But even without touching it, I can see that some are still freshly white.

I grab the book, finding a piece of string connected to it. I also hear a bell go off in the distant. The sound is muffled but definitely there.

Sydero comes down a minute later, somehow avoiding all of the wrong steps. I place my attention back on the string, following it back into the larger room. We don’t have to do anything as a hidden door suddenly is thrust open, a boy looks back at us.

[[Continue-&gt;WLD1_4]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="528" name="WLD1_5" tags="" position="930,2202" size="100,100">This area was completely different from the area we were in before. Whereas that place was decaying with every minute, this area was actually habitable. Not only was it livable, but it was easy on the eyes, reminding me of a comfy studio apartment. The floor was a soft plush carpet, and the walls were made out of a brick that wasn’t decaying. There was a mini kitchen on the far side, even with a mini bar. On the wall closest to the staircase rests a large sized bed, the question there being how he got it down here. 

Lastly, and perhaps the most impressive thing, was the large two monitor set-up on the wall. A classy desk was there, but the computers were nothing if not amazing.
&lt;&lt;if $cmajor is &quot;Computer Science&quot;&gt;&gt;\

	I wipe the bottom of my lip, fearing that I was drooling at the sight of his setup. It was beautiful, utterly beautiful.
	
	“This is amazing,” I finally say, and Bradley smiles in pride.
	
	“I actually did this all myself.”
	
	“You built your desktop?” He nods, wiping away a fake tear. Just who was this kid?
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“So,” Bradley starts, gesturing to the room with his arms wide, he pivots on his heel and looks at Sydero, “what are you doing here? I mean, not that I’m not glad to see you.”

She sighs deeply, “when’s the last time you actually spoke to someone?”

“Just yesterday, I was screaming at some twelve-year-old who told me to eat shit cos I kept killing him.”

“That doesn’t count,” Sydero corrects, sitting on his bed, “also, you need a new door for the front.”

“Seriously, Syd! Again!” Bradley screams, falling into his seat dramatically, “what do you think, doors grow from trees? Don’t answer that, I know where doors come from.” He spins around so that he was facing his monitors, typing faster than anyone I’ve ever seen.

[[“Exactly what do you do, Bradley?”]]

I reach out and grab the shiny object, hearing something click and then seeing a thick cloud of gas crawl towards me. Thanks to the speed, I was able to back away in time, but it continues to approach. I have no idea what it is, and if it was meant to fill the entire house, we were on a time limit.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“What did you do?” Chris asks, coming to my side and viewing the gas. The good thing about Chris is that he wasn’t overly curious about this life. Example of this was him turning on his heel and walking away as soon as he saw it.
					
	Sydero comes down a minute later, somehow avoiding all of the wrong steps. She spots the cloud of gas and gives us both an unimpressed look.

	“What, you behind Wall Street or WikiLeaks?” Chris asks jokingly. Bradley stares at him, neither claiming or disclaiming it. The two end up staring at each other for a couple more seconds before Sydero clears her throat.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“Undiscovered meaning what?” I ask.
		
“Meaning I don’t work for some notorious hacking group,” he answers, twiddling his mouse as he sighs.
		
“Part of me would love to, but the other part is just too lazy and selfish to care about the greater good.”

	“Oh, excuse me, we can’t all grow some half-ass stubble. Doesn’t make the rest of us any less of a man,” Bradley says and points to Chris’s stubble to further prove his point. I clear my throat, trying not to laugh as the two went back and forth. Finally, Bradley raises his hand to bring Chris’s talking to an end.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“No, I didn’t know,” I answer.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“I’m sixteen, though I’m going to be seventeen in ten months.”

“Backup generators that I set up, as well as the windmills farther back. It wasn’t easy, but I was able to convert the energy and feed it to the generators to create power. Of course, that’s the condensed version, and I doubt any of you will be able to follow me.” I open my mouth to challenge him, but Sydero throws a nasty look my way.
		
“Nor do we care, since we didn’t come here to listen to you brag,” she tells him.

Bradley continues to stare at me as if I had recently grown a second head and was trying to figure out how to tell me.
		
“He’s a human, Roe,” Sydero quietly says from beside me, her eyes meeting mine as she smirks, “he’s just annoyingly smart and resourceful.” I glance back at Bradley whose attention is no longer on us, but the dual screens in front of him.

[[Continue-&gt;WLD1_6]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="538" name="“Why here?”" tags="" position="1036,2409" size="100,100">“Why here? You could have set up anywhere, and you choose an abandoned home?”
		
“No one comes poking around abandoned places, and I wanted to get off the grid. I used to be closer to a town but stealing power from them raises eyebrows, and I was close to being caught. So, I came here.” Syd’s words from earlier make their way back into my head, how long this kid has probably gone without any kind of socialization. Plus, where were his parents?

	“Boy,” Chris chooses to correct, gaining an irritated glare from Bradley.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

Sydero chuckles, “Bradley, I’m sure two of those hidden tabs of yours are showing porn, get real.” A cherry red blush spreads across his face, reminding me that despite all of his accomplishments, he was still nothing but a teenage boy.
&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\

	“Hold up, porn?” Chris asks, acting as if a boy his age shouldn&#39;t even know what sex is.
	
	“I’m sixteen, living on my own, and I like big butts, please try to keep up.”
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“Seriously?” I chuckle, “porn?”

	“I’m sixteen, living on my own, and I like big butts, please try to keep up.”
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

“Demon named Raum,” Sydero cuts in, rolling her eyes impatiently, “heard of him?”

“Of course, one of the earls of hell.”
&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	
	“How many earls of hell are there?” Chris cuts in.
	
	“Enough for me not to go into it, but not enough to make it seem like every demon ever is an earl in some way,” Bradley answers.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“We need as much information on him as you can give us. Why he’s here, how he got here, and how to get rid of him.”

“Easy, can figure out what you need before the day is up. But wait, there&#39;s more,&quot; Bradley exclaims, grabbing a thick folder and handing it to Syd, &quot;I&#39;ll look into this demon of yours if you look into this.&quot; Sydero opens the folder and gazes at some of the pages, raising her brow and meeting Bradley&#39;s gaze.

&quot;Werewolves?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re eating all the attractive women! Stop them!&quot;

“How would you know, you don’t leave this room.”

Bradley groans, “I was kidding, I have to eat someway. And each time I walk into that town, I hear about how some girl has been snatched up by unknown folks.” 
&lt;&lt;if $perception &gt; 10 or $cmajor is &quot;Communication&quot;&gt;&gt;\
	
	“What happened to you not caring about the greater good?” I ask, leaning on the nearby wall as Sydero looks through the folder.
	
	“I don’t care,” Bradley states, glaring at me for pointing out such thing and then blushing, “I just don’t think innocent folks should be killed because of stupid //werewolves//.” The way he said werewolves made me think that he had some kind of personal vendetta against them.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

Sydero continues looking through the file, her eyes sweeping past the words before she closes it abruptly. She nods at Bradley and turns to go, stopping right before she passes me.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“If you don’t mind, I’m going to stay here with shortstop here. That’s cool with you?” Chris asks, nudging Bradley.
	
	He places a fake smile on his face, “sure is, dad! Can’t wait to hear how many more horrible nicknames you have in store for me.” The smile disappears, and a glare replaces it, one that he also tosses our way.
	
	“Roe will be joining you,” Sydero informs.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“You’re staying here.”
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“What? No, I’m coming with you,” I argue, further making a point of this as I follow her towards the stairs.

“We both know you’re not ready to go up against some werewolves, plural. So yes. You’re staying here. Plus, I work faster on my own, not trying to worry about your blood on my hands.”

She moves towards the door, and I follow, causing her to stop in her tracks once again. She turns to me and crosses her arms calmly, far too calm for my liking.

	“Whenever they want to. They’re not restricted to a full moon, but they can only appear as werewolves at night. During a full moon they transform regardless, but during a new moon they can&#39;t transform at all.”
	
	“How do werewolves track?”
	
	“Like a regular dog, through their sense of smell.”
	
	“And?” Sydero questions, raising a victorious brow.
	
	“There’s an and?”
	
	“They can also smell someone’s emotions,” Bradley answers, sipping from an energy drink, “if they’re loud enough, I guess you can say.” I don’t recall seeing that information in the book but who knows when it was written, new things were bound to arise. I look back at Sydero who appears to have made up her mind, all because I failed to get one question fully right.
	
	Much to my amazement, she nods and motions for me to come.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	My mouth closes shut, Sydero knowing that I haven’t opened up one of those books since she first placed them in front of me. Clearing my throat, I try to think of what Sydero had told me in the past, mostly when discussing Officer Petri.
	
	“Um, silver. Silver kills them,” I recall. Bradley stifles a laugh, but Sydero doesn’t see the humor in it.
	
	“Well, you’re not wrong,” Bradley tells me, “silver, slicing up their heart, beheading, all ways to kill a werewolf. They can also track you by scent or smell your emotions.”

	“Hold up, $name,” Chris states, grabbing my forearm to bring me to a stop. He bites the inside of his cheek, “be careful, okay? I don’t think I can survive without you, I mean cos of Sydero. I think she’ll kill me without you here.” I chuckle and nod my head, leaving to catch up with her.

&lt;&lt;link [img[images/divider.png]] &gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/link&gt;&gt;
	Chris watches as the trapdoor closes, his insides churning uneasily as images appear in his head. Images of werewolves tearing his best friend apart. He shudders, turning to face Bradley who no longer was concerned with him. He was typing furiously at his computer, five websites coming up on the screen. Two sites held religious texts, while the other three held demonic looking figures. Chris tore his eyes from it, sighing as he went back to the mini bar. Why a kid his age had one, Chris would never know, and he’d rather not ask.
	
	He runs his hands through his hair, his thoughts still on $name. Maybe he should’ve gone, if only to provide an extra pair of eyes to help out. But he wasn’t brave like $name, he couldn’t hold his weight, let alone help out if it came to it. He was useless.

			He takes a long sip of the alcohol, trying not to think of all the ways that this could go wrong. $name would be okay and in a few hours would come walking through those doors, declaring her success. Chris smirks at that, hardly having to imagine Sydero’s stumped look after realizing that $name could hold her own. It was something Chris always knew.

			Freshmen year was just the start of their adventure, an adventure that has obviously not seen its ending yet. He remembered a lot of their adventures, how many times $name had his back, and how many times he had hers. Like when he practically forced her to save him from his parents, and she agreed to come to dinner with them. 

			A light blush spreads onto his face at the thought. His mother was completely in love with $name by the end of the night, and she ended up asking him numerous times why they were just friends. At that moment, Chris simply answered with the obvious answer, they were friends, there was nothing there. But each year he found himself doubting that more and more. The fear he felt when he thought he would never see her again, that itself was scarier than getting kidnapped by that Raum guy.

			Despite this, he still didn’t know what it meant. If it meant that they were just really close and cared for one another, or if there was something ... else. He would be lying if he said he didn’t find $name attractive, a lie that anyone would be able to see. She was beautiful, but –

			“Hey, cliché jock, can you stop drinking all of my alcohol?” Bradley questions, throwing his hands out at the drink resting in Chris’s hands.

			“You don’t need it anyway, kid,” he snorts, taking a sip but never dropping Bradley’s gaze.

			“Oh, two can play this game, //Christopher//.”

			“It’s just Chris,” he chuckles, sitting back, doing his hardest not to think of the danger his friend was about to put herself in.

But, there were times where Chris doubted that, that he believed something else, something more significant than just being friends, caused him to feel such fear.

I drive towards the town as Sydero continues to gaze through the folder that Bradley had given her. The previous times I surmise that she had just skimmed over it, this time she was actually reading through.

“What does it say?” I ask, leaning over before she nudges me back into my seat.

“It’s information on all of the women that have been taken or killed so far, as well as a map of where Bradley thinks the werewolf den might be. He did a good job on this. The latest report says that the most recent kidnapping was just yesterday. It says that the police found some blood on the ground and the woman’s phone was gone. No body.”

“You really think the police will just let us trample on their scene?”

“No, but there are ways past that. And sometimes you have to do illegal stuff to figure it out. All part of hunting. So, get ready to learn, and only do as I say. This isn’t some silly game or practice, this is real.” I nod, rolling my eyes since this was the fifth time that she had chosen to remind me of this.

“You know, Sydero, it takes more muscles to frown than to smile.” Her face scrunches up in confusion.

“That makes no sense, if you don’t ever smile then those muscles never get used; therefore that’s selective.” I end the conversation there, chuckling as she grumbles about all the ways the saying is crazy.

We arrive at the alley that Bradley had marked. There was nothing special about it, just an alley that probably looked the exact same as the others. We know we’re in the right place because of the police tape though. The two of us walk past it like it’s not there, gazing around the alleyway in curiosity.

“Look around,” she tells me, taking her own advice as well.

The alleyway is in the middle of two tall brick buildings, one that looks like an apartment style building, while the other seems abandoned at best. Windows begin on the second floor and continue on, along with retractable stairs for the outdoor walkways. Along the alleyway sit multiple small trashcans and one large one, over-filled with an assortment of trash. I spot a homeless man down there as well, rummaging in one of them but otherwise staying far away from us.

I stand beside it, looking at the crevices in the walls, and on the ground. The blood that the report detailed still sits there, staining the dirty grey cement, though I realize it adds a dash of color to it all as well. Like Sydero had said before, there’s nothing else there.

I straighten up, looking around and coming up with nothing. Sydero comes over.

“Find anything that might help us?”

I suppose in a town like this, this was the best one could do. Stained carpets, wallpaper peeling, and a fan that might as well be turned off since it spun slowly and was making a continuous creaking sound.

Sydero grabs my attention, walking down a hallway and going into a room that clearly stated employees only. The room held a large host of supplies, from spare uniforms to cleaning materials, to bed sheets and other equipment. Sydero was only concerned with the extra uniforms, she walks over and pulls two of them that have maintenance labels on them.

	“Wow, I’m suddenly reliving my weekends, thanks to theatre.”
	
	“You did theatre?” Sydero questions, cocking her head to the side, curiosity showing.
	
	[[“I was the assistant director and sometimes writer.”]]
	[[“I was an actor.”]]
	[[“I was technical theatre, yea.”]]
	[[“I helped with the sets.”]]
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“You have got to be kidding me,” I sigh.

	“What? This is the best part of the job.”

	“Roleplaying?”

	“Who doesn’t like a bit of roleplaying?” Sydero asks, winking at me before putting the uniform on over her clothes. I follow her lead, seeing that we were actually going to commit to this.

	“You do this a lot, I take it?” I ask as I zip up the front of the shirt, growling in disgust. This was perhaps the roughest material I’ve ever felt, and even with it laying on top of my clothes, I could still feel it.

	“Yep. Sometimes I even have to don a police uniform. For hunters, this is an everyday thing,” she continues to tell me, grabbing a clipboard while I grab a toolbox, “but specialists don’t really have to do this often.”

“You can go dumpster diving on your own time, Roe,” she chuckles.
		
“Funny. But this is where she was hiding, for all we know she threw her phone in here before whatever happened, happened.”
		
“Then be my guest, lift that sucker up and see.” Of course. I turn and lift the lid, the smell of week-old trash assaults my nose, causing me to turn and take several deep breaths.
		
“We can just agree that it’s not in there. Plus, what would her phone do for us,” I say nervously. Sydero snorts, again looking around. Her eyes land on the windows across the alleyway.
		
“That window, it’s low enough to see everything that would’ve happened.”
		
“How do you know someone was watching at the time though?”
		
“Doesn’t hurt to check, that and that window is the only one whose curtains are open.”

“Oh, be my guest,” Sydero chuckles, “go down there and rough up the old man.”
		
“You don’t think he saw anything?” I question. She shrugs coolly and leans on the brick wall.
		
“Guess we won’t know till you go talk to him.” I huff and march down there. The homeless man sees me but doesn’t run; instead, he stiffens, his eyes considering my every move.
		
“Did you happen to see what happened yesterday? To the girl who was attacked?”
		
“I already told the cops that I didn’t see anything. Everyone always blames the homeless guy. You think I want those problems on me? Frankly, I’m offended she decided to choose //my// alleyway for those shenanigans.”
		
I stare at him, dumbfounded, “so you’re more worried about your alleyway getting cut off than the woman who was possibly kidnapped?”
	
“That has nothing to do with me. Think anyone cares when I get robbed or bullied? Think anyone cares that I’m homeless?” Obviously, the man hasn’t seen anything and besides him wanting to get a rant off his shoulders, was no help to me. With shoulders slumped, and my eyes refusing to meet Sydero’s, I trudge back over to her.

“Correct me, but it looks like you just got a verbal lashing from that guy,” she snickers. I don’t correct her, but I also don’t humor her. She nudges me and nods her head to a window.
		
“I think we got our first clue. That window, it’s low enough to see everything that would’ve happened.”
		
“How do you know someone was watching at the time though?”
		
“Doesn’t hurt to check, that, and that window is the only one whose curtains are open.”

I nod and direct her attention to a second-floor window. At first, it was unimportant, but the window continually grabbed my eye. And under scrutinization, I realized why.
	
“That window is low enough for someone to be able to see everything that went on. Also, it’s the only window around whose curtains aren’t closed. Could be a coincidence, or it might not.” Sydero nods, and we enter the building.

We know it’s the second story, but we don’t exactly know the room.”

“That’s why we have these,” she tells me and points to the uniforms that we had just stolen, “we knock on each door and see what we can find.”

&lt;&lt;if $creativity &gt; 10 or $cmajor is &quot;Creative Arts&quot;&gt;&gt;\
	Once we get to the second floor, I take the lead like Sydero had suggested, knocking on each door and taking on the role as maintenance. While I talked to the people, explaining to them why we were there and asking them questions, Sydero checked the apartments for windows. Each one turns out to not have the window we’re searching for and after thanking them, bid them goodbye. We continue this routine until we come across an older woman, both Sydero and I spotting the window with the drawn back curtains.
	
	“Sorry to interrupt you, we’re here for routine inspection. Spraying for pests and making sure everything is in correspondence to your lease,” I tell her.
	
	“I thought that was on the second of the month?” she asks, though she moves out of the way to let us in. Sydero fails to answer, going straight to the window and peering out of it in curiosity. I continue to keep up appearances, walking around with a spray and acting as if I was checking things over.

	Sydero clears her throat and throws me a look, clearing her throat once again before saying, “$name, remember what we were talking about this morning? About that girl?”

	“Oh yea, the one who got kidnapped in the alleyway?”

	“Yea, there was an update. They said there was one attacker and –,” Sydero starts. Her words are said to me, but her eyes are on the woman.

	“That’s a lie,” the woman suddenly blurts out, immediately frowning and looking sheepishly into her mug.

	“How would you know?”

	The woman opens her mouth but then bites her tongue, shaking her head, “nothing. Continue your work.” She gets to her feet and walks towards her room, our window of opportunity closing.

	[[Stop her.]]
	[[Let Sydero handle this.]]
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	Once on the second floor, Sydero bangs rapidly on the first door we come to, shouting maintenance. As soon as the occupant opens it, she sticks her head in and looks around. Finding no window, she turns and goes, stating that she knocked on the wrong door. The occupant and I exchange looks, both of us not knowing what had just happened. Of course, Syd would be the type of person who can make someone feel uncomfortable without even stepping foot in said person’s house.

&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
Though her method was rude, it was also fast and would help us find the right apartment quickly. I allow her to continue this, going from one apartment to the next, knocking wildly on the door and shouting maintenance, before moving on. The fourth door we get to ends up being the jackpot. Sydero calms down upon seeing the window, nodding her head at the older woman.

Before we can get to the next door I stop her, “I got this. With the rate you’re going, we’ll have security called on us or something.”
		
“What am I doing wrong?” she questions, genuinely curious. It was the innocence in her voice as she asks the question that has me shocked mostly. The fact that she seriously didn’t know why I was stopping her was humorous, if not a problem we would need to address later.
		
&lt;&lt;if $cmajor is &quot;Communications&quot;&gt;&gt;\
	“I’m a communication major, I got this,” I reassure her, about to knock on the next door when she stops me.
			
	“Just because you’re a comm major doesn’t mean you know how to talk to folks.”

	“No, that’s what it means. I mean, I guess if you study comm theories or go strictly into film, but still, communication is still a major factor, and we have to take other classes that aren’t always –”
			
	“Alright,” she blurts out, “I didn’t ask for your entire college history. Just knock on the damn door.” I do as she asks. It doesn’t go as fast as her plan, but we don’t end up scaring any of the people who open their doors either.
			
	When we finally get to the apartment in question, the old woman seems weary, more so than most people her age.
		
	“Sorry to interrupt you, we’re here for routine inspection. Spraying for pests and making sure everything is in correspondence to your lease,” I tell her.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“Well, for one, after you’re done banging and screaming maintenance at people, you just rudely poke your head in before walking off. They don’t know what’s going on and they’re probably on edge because of what happened yesterday.”
			
	“All of this doesn’t sound like my problem.”

	“Which is why I should take over.” I move her out of the way and follow through with what I say. It doesn’t go as fast as her plan, but we don’t end up scaring any of the people who open their doors either.

“It was a group of men, five or six of them. I first heard someone talking to someone and didn’t pay it any mind, but then I heard muffled screams. I saw the girl through the window, two men in front of her when the others came. I ... I was about to call the cops, really, but I saw their eyes glowing yellow, and I was terrified. They were talking about taking her to a den and how long they should keep her alive.” The woman wipes her eyes even though I spot no tears.

Sydero walks to the corner, unfolding the map that Bradley had given us. She mouths to me to ask the woman which direction they ran off in. I ask the woman, and she points to the right, now in hysterics over the memory she had recounted.

	&quot;Trust me when I say, whatever you probably saw, I’ve seen worse. I knew the girl, we went to high school together. I would just like to know what’s going on around here, there have been too many women dying. So if you know something, at least tell me so I can tell the cops. You don’t have to say anything,&quot; I tell the older woman, almost every word being a lie. I suppose this is what my life will end up being, me constantly lying to save others.

&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

She shakes her head, looking as if she would cry at any minute.

&quot;We don&#39;t have time for this old woman,&quot; Sydero growls under her breath.

&quot;You catch more flies with honey,&quot; I remind Sydero.

She growls loudly, punching the wall in irritation, &quot;stop using phrases that make no sense!&quot; I wonder if all of her hunts go this way, or if this was the main reason she was a specialist, a lack of having to deal with others.

&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
“Try us, we’ve seen quite a few things in life,” Sydero encourages. The woman continues to shake her head, almost to her room. Sydero takes a few long strides, getting to the woman before she gets to the closed door. I can see all the ways in which this could go, all of them going wrong and none of them actually getting us closer to finding where the den might be. I stop Sydero before she can do anything else, further pushing the woman into her shell.

&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
Sydero motions for us to leave but it didn’t sit right with me, leaving this woman sitting here like this.
		
“I’ll tell the cops and I know they’ll find the girl. It’s not your fault, you didn’t know what to do. You froze, we all do.” The woman doesn’t stop her bawling, but she does calm down slightly. Enough for me to feel better about abandoning her in such a state.

We head down the stairs, putting the uniforms back where we found them before going back out to the car.

“Where are we headed?” I inquire, starting the car up and pulling off the curb.

“The eastern side of town. If their den was the other way, then it makes no sense for them to run to the right.” 

Despite the small town feel that the town held, it also carried a charming rustic one. A simple yet enjoyable lifestyle that some found intriguing. Small businesses line the streets, causing me to believe that this was the downtown area, though I doubt they held an uptown. This wasn’t much different than the previous town we were in, slightly bigger and fewer eyes watching our every move.

My mind travels a short distance into the future, trying to figure out what would await us. Was I truly ready for this? Or was I going too fast, too curious and prepared to jump into something I didn’t understand?

&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
I wasn’t a fan of waterworks, and even more, I freeze when it comes to comfort. Luckily, Sydero was in a rush, and our getaway was made without the woman asking any questions.

We head down the stairs, putting the uniforms back where we found them before going back out to the car.

[[Continue-&gt;WLD2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="563" name="WLD2" tags="" position="2048,2199" size="100,100">We arrive in the eastern woods a few minutes later. Sydero goes to the large bag that she grabbed before leaving Bradley’s place. Inside I find numerous guns, what look to be charms, knives, machetes, and a stick. While she rummages through the duffle bag, I admire the forest. Hopefully, it was faerie free. Otherwise, this plan just got five times more unattractive.

In a lot of ways, these woods remind me of the Honeycutt Forest. There was a lack of utter beauty that the Honeycutt Forest had, as well as the perfect color shades to cause one to feel relaxed, but the atmosphere was the same. Serene, full of wildlife, and attractive colors. In conclusion, I couldn’t picture a pack of werewolves hiding out here.

“It’s going to take us forever to find their den.”

“Not really,” Sydero immediately answers, “werewolves mark their territory.”

“You mean they pee on trees and bushes?”

“No, Einstein. They mark trees by clawing them.” She loads a gun and then grabs a long silver and black dagger.

&quot;Stay here,&quot; Sydero tells me.

&quot;No, I’m coming.&quot;

&quot;I’ve been stuck in a car with you for three days so far, I think both of us need some alone time. Plus, you’re not ready for this.&quot;
&lt;&lt;if $supernatural &gt;= 5&gt;&gt;\

	&quot;I thought we already talked about this and I’m pretty sure I passed.&quot;

	&quot;No. You passed the oral exam not the physical. Saying how to kill something is different than actually doing it.&quot;
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“How am I ever supposed to show you I can if you won’t let me?” It was a good question, one that she couldn’t argue with. What was the purpose of me coming if she would only make me stay in the car?

&lt;&lt;if $sydero &gt;= 40&gt;&gt;\
	She gets ready to argue when suddenly her mouth closes, she narrows her eyes and shakes her head in annoyance, “fine, you want to prove yourself? Be my guest. Just be vigilant, I&#39;d hate to have to drop what I&#39;m doing just to save your incapable ass.”
	
	She grabs another gun and loads it up, sliding it to me. I expect her to say something else, anything, but she doesn’t. She gives me one last lingering look before walking into the forest.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	She gets ready to argue when suddenly her mouth closes, she narrows her eyes and that twisted smirk of hers appears, “fine, you want to prove yourself and die in the process? Be my guest. I’m sick of babysitting you anyway.”

&lt;&lt;link [img[images/acttwo.png]] &gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/link&gt;&gt;
I walk behind Sydero, my hands lingering down to my pants leg once again, making sure that my blade and gun still sit there. Despite the calmness of the forest, I was on edge, probably thanks to what happened with the faeries. It was hard to relax, but I do my best, especially since Sydero wasn’t on edge.

The air is fresh and rich with the fragrance of sharp woody pine. Due to the time of day, daylight streams into the forest, encouraging the critters that run about to be active. Summer was quickly approaching, but one could not tell due to the soft breeze that dances through the woods. I realize what made this forest starkly different than that of the Honeycutt Forest. Whereas that forest’s colors were saturated and warm, this one had colder tones. The colors weren&#39;t desaturated enough to invoke a feeling of fear or stillness, but enough to please the eye and create a calmness with those who trek through.

I’m so busy taking in the forest that I run into Sydero’s back. She sends me a glare before placing her attention back on the map, marking another X. So far, there were three large red X’s decorating the paper map, each reminding us that we were wasting time and no closer to finding the den.

“I think Bradley got the locations wrong,” I mention, finally breaking the silence.

Sydero doesn’t immediately answer, her eyes going from the map to our surroundings, she growls in frustration, “there’s no way we can find them though.” Even though she voices her frustrations aloud, she continues to walk towards the last piece of forest that we haven’t checked.

Minutes on top of minutes pass by, and my feet grow tired. It is then that Sydero outstretches her hands, stopping me. Her eyes scan the surrounding area, and before I can ask her what has gotten her on edge, I spot claw marks on a tree. A few other trunks mirror it, one deep slash.

“From this point on,” Sydero whispers, “lose any strong emotions. Sadness, anger, fear, especially fear.” I wasn’t some stone-cold killer; therefore, the art of ‘losing one’s emotions’ was lost on me. I do what I believe is best, meditating and letting go of my thoughts. I clear everything from my mind, imagining myself as a blank slate.

	“Yea, I took martial arts and gotten into a few fights.”
			
	“Those random fights might serve you better, martial arts give you a discipline and a style, doesn’t really help to go against someone who wants you dead. Trust your instincts –,” she suddenly stops, gazing back at me, “scratch that, don’t listen to your instincts. Your instincts tell you to join random people you know nothing about. That knife of yours, trust that.”
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“No, never needed to when I can just talk myself out of situations, either that or I just don’t get into them at all.”
			
	“Stay out of the main fighting then, focus on defense and make sure to stay near me. Werewolves typically attack their own target, but we’ll be outnumbered.”
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

[[Continue-&gt;WLD3]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="567" name="WLD3" tags="" position="2380,2201" size="100,100">We walk forward, coming across a large house. There was no way this wasn’t it, especially since the claw markings only increased. Every tree now bears a mark. We creep up the side, placing our backs to the along the wall of the house. We approach a window and peer through it.

The cabin reminds me of any typical forest lodge, furniture is all wood and has a rustic feel to it. There’s a wall full of animal heads, mounted to boards. A row of shotguns right beside it. The only thing that you wouldn’t find in any other cabin was the large steel cage resting along the wall. A woman hangs on the bars, weeping in front of two men.

“Can we just kill her?” one of the men growl, his words causing the woman to sob louder.

“You know we can’t,” the second answers, running his hand down his face, “she’s for the weanlings.”

“Those were the days. The days we were brought food and didn’t have to worry about hunting for it.”

“That and we were allowed to feed on humans instead of rabbits and squirrels.” The door opens, and a third man walks in, wiping his hands off with an already dirty rag. All three men look around the same age, early thirties, stout, and covered in hair that they refuse to cut.

“She the last one?” the newest man asks.

“Yea, we weren’t told to get more.”

“We got three more hungry weanlings, there’s no way this one’s going to fill all three of them.”

“She’s a virgin,” the largest one answers, this particular werewolf reminds me of a bodybuilder who goes on protein only diets. He would also be the type to go to the gym and stare at himself in the mirror, hogging each machine.

“That might work. Cut the heart in three and let them drink the blood to supply the rest of what they need,” the man with the dirty hands bobs his head from side to side, as if trying to calculate the odds. He finally nods and motions for them to grab the woman. They do so happily, both men catching her and pulling her. She fights for her life, thrashing like a wild animal. The bodybuilder grabs her by her hair, dragging her across the floor in irritation.

“Follow me,” Sydero whispers, turning so that she can round the side of the house. In a crouched position we follow the woman’s screams, catching sight of a nearby shed.

[[“What’s so special about virgins?”]]

&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
“What’s so special about virgins?” I question Sydero in a low tone, so hushed that I hardly hear myself ask the question.
		
“Virgins are ... untainted, I guess. The lore on the importance of virgins goes back to old days, biblical. It’s believed that they have the purest of souls, a step up from a child’s soul,” Sydero answers, her head turning just enough so that she can see me out of her peripheral view. “Are you a virgin?”

[[“I am.”]]
[[“Nope.”]]
[[Refuse to answer.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="569" name="“Weanlings?”" tags="" position="2386,2414" size="100,100">“Weanlings? What are those?” I question Sydero in a low tone, so hushed that I hardly hear myself ask the question.
		
“A recently turned werewolf that hasn’t completed their transformation yet. To transform, they have to eat a human heart and then wait for the full moon. I wish I knew when the next full moon was, must be close though.” She peers up at the sky, though it was pointless since the moon was nowhere to be seen.

We grow closer to the shed that the werewolves had gone into, the woman’s whimpers growing even louder than before.

“You go in that way, stay to the shadows,” Sydero tells me, darting off before I can even process what she said. The werewolves have their back to me, all of them staring down at the woman as she tries to get away. Watching her reminds me of how helpless we are at the end of the day, up against men and women like them. If I didn’t know anything about them, then that could easily be me. Just the amount of knowledge I did possess could save me.

The shed was mostly empty, a few tables and chairs scattered around. I stick to the shadows like Sydero suggested, hiding behind tall storage lockers and tables. As I go, I continuously tell myself to keep calm. One of the werewolves perks up, and I freeze, watching as his eyes scan the far wall, his attention not on me. I back up, heading towards a bin when I hear something metallic in my ear, joined by something rubbing against my shoulder and tipping.

The metal bucket tips over, all of its contents falling onto my shoulder and back. A few of the items drop off of me and onto the floor. Long entrails and other organs plop onto the ground, the blood that resides in the bucket slowly seeps off of me, filling my nose with its metallic odor.

“I am, is this the part where you try to make a joke out of it?”
		
“I don’t care about your sex life in that manner. I’m asking because if //they// find out, you’ll be on their list.”
		
“How can they find out?”
		
“They’ll have to get close. Think of how dogs know when another is in heat, their senses can pick it up. Kinda kinky if you ask me.” I grumble.

I can’t help the feeling that builds in my stomach, rushing upwards and finally out of my mouth. I can’t keep down the bile, no matter how hard I try. The smell, the sight, the realization that it was on my back, it was all too much.

The werewolves jerk around at the sound of metal hitting the shed floor, their eyes each turning gold and they bare their canines at me. They prepare to attack me when Sydero suddenly appears behind one, her knife jutting through his heart. The one closest turns his attention to Sydero, pouncing on her immediately to avenge his fallen brother. The other werewolf charges toward me.

I let the werewolf come to me, reminding myself of all the upper hands he possesses. He was faster and stronger on his feet, but I possess the only thing that can kill him. I just need to play this smart. Pulling out my knife right now would cause him to stop and reevaluate his attack, the opposite of his blind rage right now.
		
Remembering that the werewolf was faster than me, I grab my knife earlier than I would with an average human. I slash him, successfully swiping it across his chest. He whimpers the same way a wounded wolf would, backing away. Thin trails of smoke rise from his chest, dissipating soon after.
	
He circles me, eyes never leaving the weapon that I was tightly grasping. Unexpectedly he charges forward, stopping short so that my blade barely misses him. He ducks under to avoid my still swinging blade and grabs my shirt, launching me through the air. With a hard thud, my body crashes on top of a table that holds strong.

&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
I wasn’t ready for this, that was something I could admit to myself. I spot Sydero on the other side of the shed, fighting off the werewolf but just barely. I reach down for my knife, causing the werewolf stalking towards me to pause. In that moment of hesitation, I dart towards Sydero, hoping to get at least halfway across the shed before my werewolf gets me. I don’t even make it that far.
	
He grabs my shirt and launches me through the air. With a hard thud, my body crashes on top of a table that holds strong.

“Came to the wrong place,” the man growls, suddenly appearing over me. He picks me up, and slams me back down on the table, my body groaning, and my head aches tremendously. “You’re about to die.”

[[Poke him in the eye.]]
[[Kick him.]]
[[Call for Sydero.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="577" name="Poke him in the eye." tags="" position="2821,2518" size="100,100">The man’s hands were preoccupied with my shirt at the moment, not thinking twice about my other limbs doing anything to deter him. He looms closer, enough for me to feel his breath on my face, and for me to take in all of the foulness of it. With him this close, I immediately bring up my hand and jab my thumb into his eye, forcing it as deep in as I could.
		
He backs away, making both a whimper and growl-like noise, but his hands never leave my shirt. Instead, he tosses me over his shoulder onto the ground, punching me harshly across the face.

He looms closer, enough to feel his breath on my face, and for me to take in all of the foulness of it. The way he was angled, if I bring my foot up and then angle it correctly, it would catch him right in the groin.

“Syd,” I say, trying to fight the man off and failing, “Sydero!” I scream louder this time, fearing for my life. The man chuckles, but his grin disappears at the sound of a gunshot. His grip on me falters as the bullet shoots through his right shoulder. I turn just in time to see the man fighting Sydero knock the gun from her hands, grabbing her and throwing her up against the side of the shed.
		
&lt;&lt;if $perception &gt;=10&gt;&gt;\
	I grab my knife, my attention back on the werewolf in front of me. His &#39;&#39;right shoulder&#39;&#39; is dripping blood, a wound that he wouldn’t be able to care for without letting his guard down.

&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“Think this is going to stop me, you must not know how healing works,” he grins but it’s the look in his eyes that causes me to disregard everything he says. They might heal faster than humans, but I can see the fear there, he wouldn’t recover fast enough.

Each step that I take towards the injured werewolf is calculated. Was I getting too close? Was I not getting close enough? What was his reach and what did he have planned now?
	
Unlike before, the man’s face gives nothing away, a blank emotion. Whatever he was planning, he wasn’t letting on. Abruptly he lunges at me, letting out a deep growl.

I prepare my knife, slashing it towards his right shoulder once he’s close enough. He whimpers, immediately cradling his right arm and backing away from me. Sweat drips down both of our faces as we stare at one 
another.
			
“I’m done with this!” he releases his arm and pounces again. Whether or not my knife makes contact with him, I’m not sure. I only hear him hiss and see the knife go flying across the floor. The force of the pounce knocks me off my feet as he pins me down.

&quot;I’ll get back to you on that?&quot; the man comments, turning his gaze back to me, &quot;just as soon as I eat this dimwit’s heart.&quot; I scream in pain as his claws dig deeper into the skin on my chest. My heart feels like it would pop out of my chest with the way it was beating.
&lt;&lt;if $darkcontrol&gt;&gt;\

	I’m suddenly reminded of the bruise resting over my heart, left by a figure whose face still haunts my dreams. Or no, it was left because of the accident that had taken place, the figure wasn’t real. Each beat causes the pain to increase tenfold, causing me to wonder if the bruise ever truly healed as normal, regardless of how I had acquired it.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

The pressure upon my chest increases and I let out another scream. But my cry is drowned out by the sound of a gunshot, and another soon follows it. The force on my chest disappears, and besides joyful weeping, the shed is quiet. I lean up, my assailant lies dead, a gunshot wound over his heart. I turn seeing Sydero on her belly, her gun still pointing towards where the werewolf was. She takes a deep breath in and places her head face down on the ground.

“Are you okay?” I question the girl we had saved, she hugs herself tightly, nodding profusely.
&lt;&lt;if $medical &gt;=10&gt;&gt;\

	I stand up, looking down at the wounds that I was able to wrap up. Thankfully, along with all of his weapons, Bradley had some medical items as well. Besides a few scratches and bruises from the men grabbing her too tight, she was fine. Though, that was only counting for physically.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $cmajor is &quot;Psychology&quot;&gt;&gt;\
	
	I stand up, sighing as I gaze down at her. She&#39;s still shaking, albeit less than she was before. Physically, she was going to be fine, a few scratches and bruises here and there, but not mentally, or even emotionally. Well, she would need a therapist, and even that might not be enough. The woman hadn&#39;t been surrounded by some regular kidnappers. Whether or not she knew what they were, she at least knew that they were trying to feed her to someone, and that was enough to mess someone up for life.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

&lt;&lt;if $nerve &gt;=40&gt;&gt;\
	The pain that I had previously been ignoring, and thanking my adrenaline for, comes back. Subtle burning that increases with every breath. Once we get back to Bradley&#39;s, I would really have to check out how bad it was.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	I whimper in pain as the pain from earlier intensifies once again. No amount of ignorance helped numb it. Once we get back to Bradley&#39;s, I would really have to check out how bad it was. I could hardly focus on the now due to the pain.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“Thank you so much,” she says, trying to keep it together and failing. Tears fall from her eyes, and she sobs quietly, though at least this time it was tears of joy. I squeeze her shoulder and go over to Sydero. She busies herself with cleaning her knife and checking her gun. Out of the two of us, it was hard to say who looked worse, especially since I hadn’t checked my chest yet. I didn’t want to see what kind of scars or scratches that monster left. Sydero, on the other hand, had bruising on her face and had a bruise on her neck from being choked. I can just barely make out the fingertip contusions resting on both sides.

“You ready to go?” I question. She glances up at me, stuffing the gun into the bag.

“There’s no way I’m getting in the car with you smelling like that,” she scrunches her nose in disgust, “you smell like guts and bodily fluids.”

“Well, that is what fell on me, how very observant of you. You just killed three werewolves, and you’re telling me you can’t handle a little smell?”

“Your stench is not some little smell. The first thing you need to do when we get to Bradley’s is take a shower.” I don’t recall seeing a shower, but then again, I hadn’t checked the entire level. For all I know he had entire spa and gym down there.

“Oh,” Sydero says, pausing before she got in the car, “you got a little something right there.” I glance into the mirror and see a small ... something, there. I go to wipe it off quickly, the tiny pale pink object hitting the ground silently. I just want to get away from this place, as soon as possible.

We drive the woman to the hospital, before heading towards Bradley’s place. The sun is just beginning to make its descent when we arrive. The air seems still, and though we were indeed in the middle of nowhere, something seems off. The house looks the same. The windows were still barricaded, the door was up and blocking any inside view, the roof was still threatening to collapse.

“Something is wrong, does something seem wrong to you?” Sydero asks, turning to me.

We both look over to the trapdoor that leads to Bradley’s real room, it was wide open.

	“Bradley? Chris?” I call out, getting no response.

	“Bradley?” I call out, getting no response.

Sydero beats me to the door, bending down and placing one of her fingers in a dark puddle. When she raises it up to the light, we both clearly see that its blood.

“How many werewolves did we kill?” Syd questions, going further into Bradley’s room.

“Three,” I answer, finding the room a mess. His dual monitors were smashed and his bed ripped to pieces. The mini bar was more like a glass mine-field. Sydero wanders towards his drawers, checking each before pulling out a small data chip. She pockets it before turning to me.

“And the old woman said she remembers seeing five or six.”

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\

“Back to the shed, they probably saw the surprise we left them and are going to be working quickly to get out of there.” I ask no more questions, getting in the car and driving back towards those cursed woods.

“I don’t know,” she answers, taking it out and looking at it, “all I know is that Bradley stole it off of some werewolves and they’ve been hounding him ever since. That’s why I was surprised when I found it. Whatever this is, it’s important to them. Bradley just hasn’t been able to hack it yet.”

But curiosity has been burning inside me since I first saw the two interact. Sydero kept everyone at arm’s length, but not him. She actually seems to care for him in a way I didn’t know Sydero possessed.
		
“Got hired by him when he was, what, ten or eleven. Said that he grabbed something from some werewolves and needed protection.”
		
“Ten or eleven?!”
		
“You’ll be surprised at how young some people are when they first get into this. Anyway, I did the job, and Bradley begged me to help him disappear, for the sake of his parents he said. So, I did. I set him up and kept an eye on him, but that’s when werewolves killed his parents, simply because there was a link. He learned that just because you try to be heroic and save others, doesn’t mean it happens. Since then he’s been on his own, and I’ve been helping him. The money I get from jobs, I send half to him. Faye helps out when she can as well.” She growls, more to herself than to me, “that kid is my responsibility. If he dies ... well, let’s just say there’s going to be hell to pay.”

We arrive back in the woods, just in time as the sun was still setting. Personally, I’d rather not be in the woods with a bunch of raging mad werewolves with super senses, whom all had a bone to pick with us ... but that&#39;s just me.

“You remember the way?” I ask Sydero as she grabs a gun and knife. She nods and takes off in a sprint in the way I guess the shed is. I ask mostly because I don’t recall the way, seeing that we had checked two other areas before finding the right one.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	Once there, I see someone packing a truck up with items in front of the shed. We stay on the outskirts, using the trees as cover as we try to peer inside. I can see two figures tied up with sacks over their heads, guessing that to be Bradley and Chris.

&quot;But you could easily have just sent him on his way,&quot; I point out.
				
&quot;And his blood would&#39;ve been on my hands. He&#39;s resourceful but the state he was in, he wouldn&#39;t have made it. Plus, werewolves were after him.&quot; She had a point, but I can&#39;t help but feel that she wasn&#39;t completely honest with me, that there was something else that had inspired her as well. I think back to her interactions with Bradley, reminding me of a worried older sister. Yea, there was definitely something else.

Sydero leaves my side, sprinting on deft feet to the side of the shed, and then disappearing within. I edge closer to it, jumping when I hear someone shouting, followed by the sound of a gun going off. I hear another gunshot, followed by someone screaming, “eat her heart!”

I don’t know if they were referring to Sydero or someone else, but it wasn’t putting me at ease to hear such words being screamed.

Suddenly, a guttural howl goes out, followed by the sounds of someone choking, or something close, it didn’t sound good. If that sound wasn’t enough to send me forward, hearing Sydero scream in pain was.

I charge forward, grabbing my knife as I peek into the shed. One werewolf has Sydero pinned down while another moves in for the kill. One lays dead and the fourth clenches their head in agony.

“Syd!” I shout, capturing everyone’s attention. It wasn’t the smartest thing, but it gave her a small opening. She swipes her hand to the right, and with the motion, a werewolf is flung across the room. With the other one’s attention just now going back to her, she grabs her knife and pierces its heart, her attention going to the werewolf she recently flung.

The last weanling approaches me, glaring up at me with bright golden eyes. I was definitely having flashbacks to earlier today, though the experience of this werewolf rivals mine. This was a weanling still, new to most of what was happening to them.

The fact that the weanling was approaching me was proof enough of where they thought they belonged. So, when a predator suddenly sees the prey charging them, it causes doubt, and that’s what I want.
		
I charge forward, running and gripping the blade as tightly as I can as I get closer. The weanling stops, confused about what they should do, if only for a second. But that was all I need, I slash at the weanling, and they barely dodge the attack, but their arm now sports a long cut.

I hear the werewolf near Sydero cry out in pain and steal a glance. Seeing her standing over him as he lays at her feet. I don’t know what she’s doing, but she’s not even touching the man. The sounds the man was making, he was dying, but how was that possible if Sydero wasn’t even –

My thoughts are interrupted as I had forgotten about the now pissed off weanling. They rush me, knocking me onto my back and sending my knife sliding across the floor. I punch wildly, most of my hits landing but it doesn’t make the weanling move off of me. They growl, their mouth coming closer and closer, were they actually going to eat me?

“Roe, incoming!” I hear Syd shout and hear the sound of metal scraping against metal. I grab the knife and plunge it into the weanling’s chest, the heart. Their eyes widen, and they cough up blood. I squint, pushing the weanling off of me before I was decorated with any more of their fluids. They whimper in inconsolable pain, trying to stand and run off but tripping and falling to the ground. Their movements cease, and their whimpers grow faint before stopping altogether.

My feet carry me away from its first punch, and my hand naturally swipes the blade towards them. Their reaction is faster than I expect, and they get away, though they now sport a long cut on their arm.

Yes, they wished to kill me first, probably would have no regrets or care later, but that didn’t matter to me. I had never taken another’s life.

But it wasn&#39;t just that, something else resides in me. The feeling feels like it was awakening, hardly strong enough to actually allow my brain to register it as anything. It was unfamiliar though. The only thing I can even think of relating it to is when someone finds out something new about themselves. Whether that new thing was a personality trait or a cool birthmark, it was the only feeling that even came close to what I was feeling. The feeling itself makes me feel uneasy, only because it wasn&#39;t a repulsive one. In a small way, it felt good.

He looks at the knife in my hands and then at the body, not saying anything but not having to. He helps me to my feet, giving me space but standing close in case I needed him.

Sydero pulls the sack off of Bradley’s head, going to untie him next.

“Huh, where all the doggies go?” he asks, his eyes jumping from one body to the next.

“We let them out for a little play time, they were getting grumpy. You alright?” Syd asks, taking the chip out of her pocket and handing it to a thankful Bradley.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“I will be, let’s get the hell away from here.” Bradley marches out, Sydero following behind him. Chris gives me a sympathetic smile before following them.

Yes, they wished to kill me first, probably would have no regrets or care later, but that didn’t matter to me. I had never taken another’s life.

But it wasn&#39;t just that, something else resides in me. The feeling feels like it was awakening, hardly strong enough to actually allow my brain to register it as anything. It was unfamiliar though. The only thing I can even think of relating it to is when someone finds out something new about themselves. Whether that new thing was a personality trait or a cool birthmark, it was the only feeling that even came close to what I was feeling. The feeling itself makes me feel uneasy, only because it wasn&#39;t a repulsive one. In a small way, it felt good.

I prepare to follow but stop, my eyes turning to see the man that Sydero had killed on her own. Curiosity burns my blood, and I approach the dead figure, stopping before I can get too close. His eyes are nonexistent, only puddles of blood resting there. Dark veins are etched over his entire face and neck. I don’t know if the death was quick, but I knew it wasn’t painless. This seems like the worst way to go.

“Roe,” I hear Sydero scream out. My feet carry me backward, but my eyes never leave the werewolf corpse.


The rest of us hang back as Bradley looks over what used to be his home. He delicately picks up a monitor and drops it back down, wiping away the tears.

“I hate werewolves,” he screams out to no one in particular, “they ruin everything. Those fucking bastards!” He kicks the side of his desk and whimpers in pain, sitting on the edge of the bed and burrowing his face in his hands. Things he spent his life making, that he was passionate in, now in ruins.

“You’re going to have to come with us, Bradley,” Sydero states, “you know that, right?” He nods but refuses to show his face.

	She turns and looks at me, “give us a minute.”

I do so gladly, not really feeling up for the company either. I take a quick shower and then grab the supernatural book. I head to the table of contents, searching for the right word before flipping to the corresponding page. A picture of an older crone stares back at me, beside her aged picture rests the word //Witch/Warlock//.

Before, I hadn’t really thought about looking up more information on what my traveling partner could do. But now, after seeing that man and knowing other things, I think being prepared is wise. I hear movement from below and wonder what I would do if Sydero came walking in and saw what I was reading.

[[I’ll just make up some lie.]]
[[Shrug it off.]]
[[I&#39;ll tell her.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="602" name="I’ll just make up some lie." tags="" position="4091,2418" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;set $honesty -=3&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
I was getting reasonably good at lying, thanks to the new job and all. Sure, Sydero would probably see through it, but she wouldn’t know for sure.

Most of the information wasn’t new. Either Sydero had told me, Faye had said something, or I already knew it. There were two different kinds of witches, practitioners and actual witches, warlocks also fell into line with witches, the only difference being their gender. Practitioners were born human but practiced Wicca, whether good or bad, and they didn’t have powers. Witches, on the other hand, were born with a specific ability that they could utilize. Both types of witches were free to go about their craft however they liked, some turn to worshipping demons and Satan, while others fought for innocents, others just did it to help out their lives, whether as a business or simply personal means.

I flip through the pages, getting to the part where they speak about power. They didn’t have each and every power a witch could possess, but it did say that they were only born with one. Sydero was able to flick people with just a hand movement and somehow could make people’s eyes burst and bleed out without touching them. Maybe that was the same power, but a large piece of me doubts that.

I search for weaknesses. Other witches, spells that strip powers, fire, of course fire, I think to myself, and then certain runes that would make a witch unable to perform. The runes weren’t in the book, neither were the spells, but there were other ways to find them. Otherwise, killing witches wasn&#39;t&#39;t as difficult as I was led to believe, you can kill them the same way you can kill a human.

I close the book, feeling conflicted about all of this. I don’t have time to think on it when the trapdoor opens, Sydero motioning for me to come in.

I wasn’t afraid of her, or perhaps that wasn’t the right way to phrase that line of thought. Sydero always warned me not to trust anyone, and she always put herself in that group. I’d tell her that this was the result of me not trusting anyone. I needed to know everyone’s weakness.

I notice a large duffel bag in the corner, perhaps all the things that hadn’t gotten torn up and messed up during the werewolf raid.

“I did learn some stuff about Raum. You know the basics, earl of hell, in charge of thirty legions of demons. He’s depicted as a crow in most religious text. Back when the world was simpler, he was known to steal treasure and had a thing for stealing the dignity of men. In your cases, he’s known as a bounty hunter. Has never missed a hunt and is not known to suffer,” Bradley looks over at me, “strays, lightly.”

&quot;Strays? What does that mean?&quot; I ask since I was obviously the so called stray.

“Meaning, since you’re still alive, you’re more valuable than just some human. You’d be dead already if you weren’t.”

“He’s not a demon like Lilith or Azazel though?” Sydero asks, performing her notorious pace.

“No.”

“Good, he’s easily killable. The biggest question now is, who called him in for the bounty.” I turn and head out, ignoring the silence that sets in due to my sudden action. I don’t care though. I need air.

[[Continue-&gt;WLD4_2]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="606" name="WLD4_2" tags="" position="4288,2206" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;audio &quot;calm&quot; loop volume 0 fadeto 0.60&gt;&gt;
I lean my back on the side of my car, ignoring the prickly feeling of sharp blades of grass poking my thighs and butt. It was the last thing on my mind. Instinctively, I gaze down at my hands, remembering that another’s blood had coated them an hour or so ago. That person had died at my hands, I ended their life. I knew and understood that it was all self-defense, that it was either them or me. That wasn’t what got me, just the feeling of knowing that the last thing someone saw was me, me sticking a sharp blade through their heart.

&lt;&lt;if $sympathy &gt;= 50&gt;&gt;\
	Try as I might, to remind myself that it was needed, I still feel sick. I respect life, that was going to be a negative trait in this life but I couldn&#39;t help it.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	The only thing making me feel even a bit better is the knowledge that I would grow numb to this. I was only feeling this way because it was my first kill. If I felt good about that then there was something wrong with me, or at least that&#39;s what I believe.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

I shiver for no reason, looking up at the setting sun. The sky was filled with a mix of combatting colors, pinks and dark oranges fighting for their last minutes. The sight was hypnotic, and the wind only helped to aid this feeling, moving the resilient grass with its strong breeze.

I suddenly feel a gaze on my back, turning to see ...

[[... Bradley.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="607" name="... Chris." tags="" position="4218,2316" size="100,100">Chris came and sat beside me, sighing as he observed the sunset.
		
“How are you doing?” he questions softly, his worried eyes resting on me.
		
“I ... I know what needed to be done, and I did it. They would’ve killed all of us, and I’m sure they wouldn’t have spent a second doubting. But, I’ve never killed anyone.”
		
“Yea, and Sydero’s &#39;get over it or else&#39; ultimatum doesn’t really help. I swear, that girl needs sympathy lessons.” I chuckle lightly. My thoughts go to Sydero and that werewolf that she had killed. But I didn’t want that thought on my mind.

		“I know I owe you my life though, the second time I think that is,” he says, chuckling. “One of these days I’m going to stop relying on you to save me.”
		
		“It’s no problem, Chris,” I smile, though the look he gives me tells me that it is. His eyes go towards my cheek, where he runs a light hand across it. At first, I think it’s a move of affection, but when he pulls it back, I see a hint of red on it.
		
		“Ugh, I swear blood is the hardest thing to clean up.” I say the words in aggravation, but also as a joke, something to liven the mood up. Chris doesn’t take it as such, his eyes still resting on my face.
				
		“Be more careful next time,” he says with a hint of a pout.
				
		“You think I wanted this?” I snicker, bringing my legs closer to me, “there’s so much that is still unanswered. And being in that room and listening to them talk about Raum, even more that I don’t know. What makes me valuable? Why am I still alive? Is it because they think I have a connection to Sydero? Each day is a trial, harder than the last. And this is what, only the first week? Barely the second if anything?”
				
		“Are you doubting this?”
		
		[[“Yes.”]]
		[[“No.”]]
	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
		“I know I owe you my life though, the second time I think that is,” he says, chuckling. “One of these days I’m going to stop relying on you to save me.”
		
		“It’s no problem, Chris,” I smile, though the look he gives me tells me that it is. His eyes go towards my cheek, he lifts his hand but with a light blush lowers it.
				
		“Um, you got something on your cheek.” I wipe at it and see a trace of red on my hand.
				
		“Ugh, I swear blood is the hardest thing to clean up.” I say the words in aggravation, but also as a joke, something to liven the mood up. Chris doesn’t take it as such, his eyes still resting on my face.

		“You think I wanted this?” I snicker, stretching my legs out and slouching, “there’s so much that is still unanswered.

	“You know you’re going to have to do it again, right?” Chris says. I think it’s a question until I repeat the statement in my hand. It was a warning, one that held value and truth. I would have to do it again, plenty more times. That’s what this life detailed, what Sydero chose to remind me every step of the way. But it wasn’t the same, doing it and saying it, there was always a long thick line separating the two.

	“What you’re feeling isn’t weird. The mind, it naturally sympathizes, even if there wasn’t much of a choice,” Chris continues. “If you ask me, you not being bothered would be much scarier. That’s what serial killers and psychopaths go through, they don’t feel empathy, they feel glee.”

	“No need for a lecture, Chris,” I say, and he instantly nods.

	“I just don’t want you beating yourself up about this.” I thank him, and we sit there in silence for a couple more minutes. Somewhere between then and now, he gets up and goes.

“I can’t tell you the last time I’ve actually watched a sunset.”

“And why’s that?” I grumble.

“You usually go after your prey at night.” Hearing her say prey makes me shiver, makes me think back to the werewolf that I killed, the werewolf she killed. For me, I was the prey, a lucky prey that was able to undermine the predator and get away. But now I wondered, was Sydero ever the game? Or did she simply like playing with her food? For all I know, I was looking too deep into this. Making her out to be the bad guy when she’s saved me more times than not.

“About what happened today.”

“I don’t want to talk about it.”

“Well, tough luck, we’re going to.” I get to my feet and turn to her, surprised to see her standing right there, looking ready for a fight.

“Now you want to talk? Funny how you only want to talk when it benefits you.”

“Well of course, the keyword is benefit.”

I take a step closer to her, “well, this time I’m walking away. Have a conversation with yourself.”

“I wanted to say sorry that you had to see my breakdown back there, I normally can control my emotions better than that,” he begins nervously, scratching the back of his neck.
	
“It’s fine. You and werewolves seem to go back.”
	
“Yea, I don’t know if Sydero told you, but they’ve been after me for some time. All because of some chip.”
	
“How do you feel about the rest of the supernatural creatures?”
		
“They are what they are. I don’t hate them but if they ever cross paths with me then who knows what might happen.”
		
“Are you a hunter?”
		
“No. I help hunters. Tons of them will ask me for information and for a price, I give it. Besides Sydero, she’s the only one who could get stuff for free.”
		
“Nice to know that she likes at least one person,” I murmur. Bradley chuckles, twiddling with his fingers.
		
“How much has she told you?”
		
“Hardly anything, does she even have a last name?”
		
“She does. But she has her reasons.”
		
“Not you too Bradley.” He nods in understanding and doesn’t go any further, the last thing I want to hear is a speech about good intentions and trust issues.
		
“I have to get the rest of my stuff ready, but we’ll be leaving soon.” He walks away, back into the abandoned house that he once called his.

“You have no idea how much I want to say everything will be okay. But I can’t. You and I both know how easy it is to get kidnapped and threatened.” He pauses, seeming to try and think of his next words. “Um, just stay safe,” he finally says.

	Chris stops, his eyes on the house but his mind still sitting beside $name as she watches the sunset. And yet again, he was worried about her. More so than he should be. He wanted to turn around and grab her, to pull her into a tight hug and tell her that it was okay. That he was there for her. But he couldn’t even be there for himself. Why was it so hard to figure out where his feelings rest? Whether he liked her or if he didn’t? Any other girl, he would be able to instantly make a decision, he’s been doing just that. He was never scared to make the first move, rejection was a feeling that would come and go. He knew that.

He didn’t have to look at them every day. $name was his best friend and being rejected by her was bound to make life awkward, especially now.

It wasn’t weird for him to hug $name. //But that’s not it, is it//, a dark voice question. Chris wipes his face, part of him just wanted to bang his head up against a wall to silence his mind.

	Chris stops, his eyes on the house but his mind still sitting beside $name as $he watches the sunset. And yet again, he was worried about $him. More so than he should be. He wanted to turn around and grab $him, to pull $him into a tight hug and tell $him that it was okay. That he was there for $him. But the feeling was weird, alien. His thoughts were jumbled in their rationalizing for wanting to do such a thing. He felt like he was betraying himself either way. These thoughts were more aggravating than even getting kidnapped.

	He was straight, Chris repeated that thought to himself countless times as he walks farther into the house. The thoughts were just graying the lines because him and $name were such good friends. It wasn’t weird for him to hug $name. //But that’s not it, is it//, a dark voice question. Chris wipes his face, part of him just wanted to bang his head up against a wall to silence his mind.

	“$$He’s your friend. That’s it, that’s all.” Saying it aloud made him feel better, but not much.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

[[Continue-&gt;WLD4_3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="612" name="WLD4_3" tags="" position="4546,2203" size="100,100">The sun sets farther until no longer existing in the sky. The sky reflects its absence and takes on the shades of the moon. Somewhere in the distance, I hear a deep mournful howl. I grab my keys and begin readying the engine, ignoring it.

Sydero gives me the newest address, a motel that wasn&#39;t too far away. When I question why we are headed there, and what our next plan of action is, she ignores me. There was only so much I could take before feeling the need to explode. I could feel it, my meter was in a dangerous place. But I drive, biting my tongue and hoping that my playlist could cool me down. Thankfully, she sat in the back with Bradley, the two of them speaking loud enough for me to hear, but otherwise was just Bradley catching her up on what he had been up to.

[[Outside the motel ...]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="613" name="WLD4_2_1" tags="" position="4326,2423" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;if $SRomance &gt;=2&gt;&gt;\
	I move to walk around her, but Sydero’s faster than me. One minute I’m walking around her and the next my back is hitting the side of my car. Sydero glares down at me, neither of us saying anything. Despite my wish to be away from her, I also crave for her to come closer. The closeness between the two of us causes me to ache in ways I shouldn’t. My anger begins to turn into something else, something I was becoming accustomed to when it came to her. She somehow manages to press herself even closer to me, her thigh just barely resting between my legs.

	She knew what she was doing, there was no way she didn’t. If she didn’t, then she was blind, if she did, then she knew the effect she had on me now. I could see her doing this simply to get a rise out of me, or to tease me when she felt like it. But even knowing this, I still wished for that to be the case.

	Her mouth is inches from mine, and through this entire thing, I haven’t dropped her gaze. That gaze that can pierce through anything.

	“Correct me if I’m wrong,” she says in a husky tone, it takes everything in me not to shiver, not to grab the front of her shirt and bring those lips to meet mine for the first time. “But weren’t you supposed to be walking away?” So, she did this to tease me. I push her away from me, straightening myself up and ignoring the ache that existed further down.

	“You must think you’re really cute,” I growl, and she shrugs nonchalantly.

	“Not as cute as you when you’re flustered.”

	“You’re an asshole,” I say plainly, walking back towards the abandoned house. It was the last place I wanted to be, but it was the only place Sydero didn’t exist.
	
	[[Continue-&gt;WLD4_2_2]] 
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	I walk away, hearing her chuckle, “you kill a weanling, and this is how you act. What are you going to do when Raum appears? Matter of fact, did you think you wouldn’t get your hands dirty?” It was funny how I said I would walk away, yet here I was in mid-turn, ready to snap at her.
			
	“It’s like you said, killing something and talking about it is two different things. But, I wonder, how heartless can one be to not feel the impact of death anymore? To just be able to randomly kill without consequence.”
			
	“Trust me, I know the consequences.”
			
	“I’m sick of these riddles of yours. For someone who’s pretty straightforward, you have a knack for avoiding questions and replacing them with cryptic messages.”
			
	“Sounds like a personal problem, Roe,” Sydero calls out, walking away. It wasn’t that she again avoided any kind of answer that made me boil over with anger. No, my rage was sparked due to something much simpler. It was because I had sworn to walk away this time, to leave her with questions and no answer. Yet here I was, the one still standing outside.
	
	[[Continue-&gt;WLD4_3]]

Sydero’s heartbeat finally came down from its high, though it wasn’t until Roe disappeared into the darkness of the house that it mellowed out like normal. It always took an extra amount of work to get her to back off from $him, especially when their bodies were so close together. Roe’s intense $eyes eyes always caused her heart to skip a beat. She wasn’t a fan of always receiving the hate-filled and annoyed glares, but it only made it that much better when she got the desire ones. The raw desire that swam through them, unchecked and ready to be discovered. It also didn’t help that Sydero was always able to place Roe in the most ... appealing positions.
			
“You need to keep yourself in check,” she told herself, berating herself for even doing it in the first place. There were only two things that could drive Sydero off the edge, and uncontrolled desire was the first. The only reason why she wasn’t too worried was because it hadn’t gotten that far. Roe was fun to mess with, and Sydero was curious, but she wasn’t //that// curious. Roe was just fun to play with. Nothing more.

	I sit on the hood of my car with Chris nearby, playing with the new phone that Bradley had given him. Turns out that Bradley had tons of unused phones, waiting for a moment like this to be put to use. He gave each of us one, the other’s numbers already inserted into each.
	
	&lt;&lt;if $uncledead is false&gt;&gt;\

&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

We wait outside of the motel room that Sydero had paid for, waiting to hear about her findings. I fiddle with the phone in my hands when suddenly the image of the weanling appears in front of me. In shock and fear, I jump backward, rolling off the hood of the car and hitting the ground harshly.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“It’s happening, $name is losing $his mind,” I hear Bradley yell out. I glance up to see Chris offering me a sympathetic, if not confused, look. I pick myself up, dusting myself off as I ignore both of their looks.

“Did you find him?” Bradley asks, quickly taking her attention off of me.

“No. He’s shrouded, but I guess I shouldn’t be surprised by that. He’s a bounty hunter, he’ll know how to cover his tracks. Let’s get the bags and call it a night.” I didn’t need to be told twice. I grab my bag when I spot a bright blue fluorescent object sticking out of Sydero’s pack. I move the flap out of the way and grab the bottle. A thick wisp of white floats aimlessly inside, it expands before shrinking back and continuing its actions from earlier. I rotate the bottle to the side and watch as the liquid slowly moves with it, whatever this is, it was thick and more gel-like than liquid.

“What’s this?” I ask Sydero. Suddenly the container is snatched out of my hand, and Sydero stuffs it back in her pack.

“Mind your own business, Roe.”

“It’s in my car, it’s my business.”

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“Guys, it’s been a long day, can we save this argument for tomorrow?” Chris asks, yawning after his thoughts are spoken.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“Really? You two are going to do this tonight?” Bradley questions.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“I’m tired of all the secrets. I don’t trust you, Sydero.”

She bows as if my words were a compliment, “great, you’re learning something after all.”

“I’ve been patient,” I say, taking cautious steps toward her, “but you hardly tell me anything. I saw what you did to that werewolf. What were you planning on doing with the faerie? What is that crap?” 

“Where is all of this coming from?” she asks, that cocky smirk of hers still on her lips. It was a good question, one that I could trace back to the day we left Faye’s place, her warning. At first, I thought Faye was saying that I needed to watch Syd’s back, to make sure she didn’t do anything crazy. But when she denied that as being her reason, I knew something was off. Faye looked frightened, uncomfortable. The questions began to roll in after that, questions that never received any answers.

“On second thought,” Sydero suddenly says, “I don’t care. Get over yourself, Roe. You’ve had a long day, and you’re tired, especially after killing your first supernatural creature.” If anyone else had said that, then I might just think that their concern was genuine. But the teasing look in Sydero’s eye and her relaxed uncaring body language told me differently. 

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	I look over at the other two, both of their eyes on me as if I was the one causing the problem. She was making it seem as if I was the one going crazy like she had done nothing wrong.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	I look over at Bradley, his eyes on me as and judging everything I did. She was making it seem as if I was the one going crazy like she had done nothing wrong.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

I thought myself a calm person most of the time, able to think through my feelings and come up with logical outcomes. So why was I getting so angry? The anger heats up my body, refusing to be subdued and wanting its release.

&quot;I&#39;m sending you the video. But spoiler alert, you&#39;re now on the police watch list.&quot; The water I was sipping comes out, decorating the top of the bar’s back counter.

“What!?”

&lt;&lt;link [img[images/divider.png]] &gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/link&gt;&gt;
“Still giving commands?” Her fist clenches more, so tight that even her fist was beginning to change colors. He gasps for air, clawing at the tie and then clawing at his desk frantically. Finally, his movements cease, his head rolls back and he slumps in his seat. Sydero stares at him for some time. When she finally moves she does it to grab a wipe, wiping the surface of his desk and grabbing the man’s wallet. She takes what she wants before putting it back, leaving the room.

“Nice doing business with you.”

&lt;&lt;link [img[images/divider.png]] &gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/link&gt;&gt;
&quot;$name, you are quite an unlucky person you know that?&quot; Raum questions, nudging the dead body out of his way, &quot;the people you meet end up dead, and now you&#39;re about to end up dead.&quot;

&quot;I’m going to be the one who kills you! Each and every one of you!&quot; I shout, fighting against Petri&#39;s grip on my arms.

“Normally, I’d walk away and leave an inch of your life still intact, just because. I mean, this is about Sydero, nothing at all to do with you. But you got in the middle of it.” He stops in front of me, cocking his head to the side. “And now you must pay.”

	“How fast does Bradley usually fix the door?” I question her, and she shakes her head.
	
	“Not this quick.”
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“You mean besides the blood on my face?” I question, looking into my side mirror and trying to get a patch of it off. It wasn’t mine and that’s all that mattered.
	
	“The door,” I hear her say and glance towards it.
	
	“What about it?”
	
	“Last I remember, I knocked it down.” I still don’t understand her worry, there was a list of reasons that could explain why the door was back up so quick.

I could never answer why, but seeing even the tiniest bit of blood could cause me to faint, and this was no exception. I clench my eyes closed, trying to breathe and failing. Thinking about it wasn&#39;t doing me any favors either.

“Let’s go $name, we don’t have all day.” My mind feels like it’s swimming in bleak, murky water. In hopes of not angering them further, I scramble to my feet, realizing how flawed that idea was later. I slowly walk to the driver’s side of the car and get in, waiting for Petri to give me the go-ahead to drive.

I stiffly drive towards the abandoned house. Continuously looking out of the corner of my eye at Petri who sits there calmly in the passenger’s seat.
    
“What’s going to happen to me after this?”
    
“All depends on how good of an actor you are. And if we get what we want,” he tells me plainly.
    
“So, the woman?”
    
“Yep. You might die, you might not.” My heart lurches to the side, and so does the car. I’m just barely able to avoid a vehicle in the next lane.
    
“Really, Petri? That’s how you word that?” Langston questions, leaning forward enough to feel included. “What’s up with you, you’re really grumpy today.”
    
“You would too if you weren’t so damn hyper all the time. I’ve dealt with enough humans today,” Petri growls, setting his gaze out the window. I don’t say anything, but my eyebrow quirks up at how he uses the word ‘human.’ Did he think himself some kind of godly figure who belonged above average people?
    
“So, you haven’t been able to feed in a while, poor baby,” Langston whines sarcastically, “you guys miss a few meals, and the world comes to an end.”
    
“Whatever, skin-molt.”

His eyes naturally came to rest on the corpse’s eyes, or lack thereof. The blood had dried up, leaving bloody trails down the side of his face. Faded black veins ran from his face to his neck, stopping at his chest. His mouth was partly open, and after dipping a nearby rod inside, it came out coated in blood.

“Did you open him up?” Raum questions, though he knew the answer. The question was to get them thinking. And to also show his displeasure of having to do it himself, especially if what he believes occurred, did.

“Um, no sir, I like to take corpses at face value,” Langston admits. He wasn’t exactly squeamish, he’s killed before though he would never say he enjoys the act. He, unlike his partner, didn’t need some human to survive. Everything about him was human, save for the tiny detail of being able to take on the appearance of whatever he wanted. It made him the weakest, and softest, of the small group, but it didn’t bother him. He was a decorated officer, who knew his way around a crime scene and a fight. His supernatural abilities allowed him to heal faster, especially if he moats and takes on a new body. The moating process itself was a nasty and ugly business, one he rarely used for he believed his natural appearance far too sexy.

Raum wastes no time, grabbing his dagger and plunging it into the dead man’s chest. The others step back in disgust once Raum has fully opened the man up, everything inside of him was mush. If Petri was hungry, he wasn’t now. Out of pure curiosity, he grabs the rod from earlier and pokes at the internal organs. His insides were turned into soup, thick disgusting soup.

“So, they liquefied his insides?” he asks, placing the rod down and turning his back to the mess.

“It’s not they,” Raum corrects, “it’s a she.”

“So, how do we find her now?”

“Remember that plan we came up with a while ago? We’re putting that into effect now. Langston, take a group with you to plant the evidence, Petri, I want you to take a group to report the crime. Take a man as the witness, make sure he’s roughed up.” They both nod in unison before barking orders to the men nearby, ushering them out and leaving Raum to stand there. His eyes linger on the cadaver before he disappears abruptly.

I pass them to the patrons, both looking skeptical and downright offended that I had dared touch their drinks.
			
“Just taste it,” I urge. They both do as I ask, their eyes widening as they take another sip, this one longer.
			
“Definitely an improvement,” they say, showering me with compliments.
			
I pat Mr. Hotshot’s shoulder, “guess you’re going to have to tweak their drinks now, huh? Since they won’t be ordering their regular drinks anymore.” He ignores me and I walk back to my empty end of the bar.

“How’s it going?” Morgan asks upon approach, eyeing the patrons that all exist further down near Mr. Hotshot.

“Could be better,” I snort, cleaning one of the pitchers. That’s what I’ve been doing mostly, washing glasses and pitchers, wiping down my side of the bar.

“I got a proposition for you. After we close up, I can teach you some tricks I know to help improve your bartending game.”

“Sounds like you’re going to have me doing this tomorrow as well,” I point out, and Morgan shrugs.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“Depends on if you can retain the information I give you tonight.” It doesn’t exactly seem like I can say no, and so I nod. Though that would mean either Chris would have to wait for me to finish up with Morgan or would have to find another way home.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“Depends on if you can retain the information I give you tonight.” It doesn’t exactly seem like I can say no, and so I nod. Why not take $mhis proposition? Especially if it would just lead to greater tips.

“Of course. The customers come first.”
			
Thankfully, Mr. Hotshot concerns himself with his side of the bar, leaving me to mine. As more customers pour in, his tips build up while mine stay stagnant. It was more due to me being a new face, and not my ability to make a drink.

I place the safeguards back up, clearing my throat before looking at a still curious Morgan.

“It’s a long story, alright. Can we just get to you showing me those tips you talked about?” Morgan doesn’t necessarily look unhappy about my stubbornness. Probably because this wasn’t the first time that $mhe’s tried to learn more about me.

$mHe sighs, joining me behind the bar, “I just want to know what your story is. This mystery act of yours has to have an off button somewhere, right?&quot; I still refuse to answer, wondering if this is how Sydero felt when I would always question her.

“What you said is true. Being a bartender is that and more. The ability to memorize a drink comes with seeing the same face every day and putting the drink to that face. But that’s not what earns you the tips. It’s giving a damn about the customer, whether you act it or genuinely want to know how their day went.” Morgan looks around for the proper word, it continuously rolls off $mhis tongue, evading $mhim. $mHe finally gives up.

“We’re almost like counselors, really bad ones that keep you calm while loading and giving you the gun. If Joe comes in here and orders and then starts talking about his no-good cheating wife, you listen. You will be surprised at how many just need an ear to vent.”

“Sounds like you want me to be their friend,” I point out.

“We help them. Make them feel better. But we also know how to tell them no more alcohol. It’s a complicated but needed relationship.” It was less complicated than what Morgan was making it out to be, and I still fail to see how all this would result in a higher tip.

“So, you mean to tell me, that just listening and acting like their friend would give me a better tip?” It was a lesson that was starkly different to the lesson I learned while working at //The Alley//. There, you had to appeal to the customers. Drop a compliment here and there, give them the drink, and accept whatever tip they decide to offer.

	“I’m fine. I’ll see you tomorrow though.” Thankfully, Morgan doesn’t stop me. $mHis eyes are trained on me, but that’s it. I grab my keys, thanking Morgan once again before walking into the chilly night. There’s a light drizzle, mostly I’m hit with nothing but the mist.

	The next day at work, true to $mhis word, Morgan has me playing bartender again. Chris didn’t appreciate me leaving him alone in the back for another day, he appreciated even less that he wasn’t given the same chance, but there was little to be done to change that.

&lt;&lt;if $sympathy &gt;=50&gt;&gt;\
	I attempt to change up my usual bartending habits in favor of what Morgan had said the other day, appealing to the actual person ordering the drink, striking up a conversation. Above all, I act as if I care, which in an odd way, I do. I care about how their life goes and how their day was going. I cared about their struggles, and how //human// it all was.
	
	Despite my attempts, Mr. Hotshot still gets all of the customers, and he makes sure to remind me of this fact each spare minute he gets. I get more customers than the previous day, but the tip’s jar depression is as depressed as my mood was becoming. Another fact that Mr. Hotshot decides to remind me of.

	I attempt to change up my usual bartending habits in favor of what Morgan had said the other day, appealing to the actual person ordering the drink, striking up a conversation. Above all, I act as if I care. This was perhaps the hardest part. I can&#39;t find myself caring about their life struggles and how much their boss got on their nerves. Their problems seemed so trivial now. Perhaps not for them and others, but for someone who has actually seen what is out there, there are much bigger problems in the world.

“Dang, $fname, what is this? Pity tips?” he questions, poking the tip jar. Only a handful of customers are still here, enjoying their last moments of being away from whatever shitty life waits for them outside these doors. “This is downright depressing.” He pats my shoulder harshly and then excuses himself to use the bathroom. My eyes roam to his tip jar. It was full, but that was only because of how the money was placed inside. I’ve watched Mr. Hotshot all day, and I knew for a fact that he never counted his tips, a fatal mistake.

He sits on the edge of the bed, fiddling with his phone and a towel draped across his bare shoulders. Bare shoulders, of course, leading to a bare chest, the man had a secret hatred for shirts, I’m sure.

Upon seeing me, he immediately goes to grab a shirt, apologizing quietly.

[[“Working out?”]]
&lt;&lt;if $int is &quot;both&quot; or $int is &quot;men&quot;&gt;&gt;\
	[[“Wait, keep it off.”]]

“Yea, it helps to take the edge off of everything, you know what I mean, right?” I nod, setting my things down on the end table and sitting on the edge of the bed. Chris obviously had more to say.

He sighs loudly, his eyes wandering to every corner of the room before he meets my eyes. “We need to talk, $name.”

&lt;&lt;if $break&gt;&gt;\
	“About what? What comes next?” Truth is I didn’t even know. I was planning on going back, but I hadn’t thought about how Sydero would feel about that. Knowing her, she would move on, and I’d be incapable of finding her. And even if I did find her, who said she wanted me back?

	“Though I’m not happy about going back, I know why you want to. But we need to talk about why you left in the first place.”
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“About what? What comes next?” Truth is I didn’t even know. I wasn’t planning on going back, but I didn’t know what else to do either. I’ve only been living this strange life for about a week or two, yet it feels like it’s been forever.

&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
“Whoa, what are you doing?” I smirk, and he freezes, his shirt hovering in front of him, “keep the shirt off.” The blush that suddenly appears on his cheeks pairs well with his soft smile. But his face was the last thing on my mind. Instead, my eyes glance at the glistening sweat that clings to his skin, allowing his skin to shimmer.

He sighs loudly, his eyes wandering to every corner of the room before he meets my eyes. “We need to talk $name.”

I snort, grabbing some night clothes and heading towards the bathroom, “no thanks. Ignorance is bliss, right?” I half expect Chris to stop me, he could be very persistent when he wanted to be, which is almost always. But he doesn’t move, he only gives me a look that rivals even that of a puppy.

“It’s not for me,” Chris whispers, I close the door but not before hearing him say, “you’re running away.”

I attempt to wash away Chris’s questions with water, closing my eyes as the water pelts down onto me irregularly. The water pressure in this motel was horrendous, one minute I barely felt it, the next I was trying to avoid it. Regardless, my mind keeps going to Chris’s question and then moves to the broad issue. Was I running away? And was running away such a bad thing? After everything I’ve seen and been through, it seems like the smartest thing.

&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
I want to deny his words, to say that I didn’t need to, but he was right. The longer I avoided it, the more it would bug me and eat away at me. Additionally, he deserved to know.

“You’re right,” I tell him, “is there something specific you want to know or just curious about why?”

“Just curious about why. That fight you and Sydero had, it seems like it’s been building, but it also seems like it came out of nowhere. Almost as if you were looking for a reason.” It was then that I filled Chris in on everything he possibly didn’t know. Faye warning me about Sydero, the dead werewolf at the warehouse, and what I had read about witches in the book. 

He sits quietly, surprisingly not bothered by everything I was telling him. When I’m through, he says only one word, “damn.” I chuckle and agree.

“But seriously, I think I see now. To Bradley and me, that fight looked like it just happened, but I should’ve known. You have way too much pressure on your shoulders right now. I guess it was only a matter of when, especially since Sydero is an instigator, not a negotiator.” I nod in agreement, feeling like some weight, though very little, has been lifted from my shoulders.

Not one part of this life made sense. Even if I was a fan of chaos and change, this was too much change for anyone. Leaving everything you know, meeting up with a stranger who, for all I know, has the ability to kill me, facing my own mortality numerous of times, and then being hunted by a demon. I left, but now I even doubted that. That’s what my life seems to have become, a series of me doubting everything.

There were three customers on his side of the bar, all deep in conversation with one another. The only other patrons were far enough away to where they wouldn’t notice anything. I could easily go over, skim a twenty or two off the top, and make it look like I wasn’t doing anything. I spot a broom in my corner and sneer, sometimes fate did work out in my favor. 

I grab the broom and begin sweeping, naturally walking over to his side to clean as well. One customer nods to me, but soon after goes back to the conversation. With deft hands, I grab one of the twenties near the top, stuffing it into my pocket before anyone sees. With the money secured and no sign of anyone noticing, I go back to my side of the bar and finish sweeping.

I don’t end up seeing Morgan until the end of the day, when $mhe comes out of $mhis office to say goodbye to everyone, except me. After closing the restaurant down, Morgan strides over to me with purpose, claiming the seat at the bar.

“Let’s see what you got.”

“Wait, now?” I ask. I suppose I should’ve known this would be the reason $mhe would want me to stay after. But it would’ve helped more had it been done yesterday or before we opened today, that way I could’ve gotten more tips.

“Yes, now. I’m a customer, one that you’ve never seen before. A complete stranger with problems, let’s go. I want a Golden Rush Cocktail.”

“Coming right up,” I turn to grab the alcohol shaker and then the ingredients needed to make the tasty cocktail. “So, how are you doing this fine night?”

“What’s so fine about it?” Morgan asks, snorting in disgust.

“I know what you mean,” I continue on, half of my attention on the conversation, the other half on the drink that I was making. I grab the honey and then the sprig mint, searching for the lemon juice as Morgan continues on.

“Ha, no!”

“Sure about that? You could’ve picked anything, any problem, and any choice of words and those were the ones you chose.” Morgan’s smile faltered, $mhis eyes going down to the drink in $mhis hands.

“I drunk, and I drunk, and I drunk some more. Didn’t help that I owned a damn bar and enjoyed bartending. It messed with everything and knowing that they still had this power over me made it worse. They were probably fucking some other person and here I was, letting my life fall apart.” We both drink silently for a while, neither of us looking at the other. We were in our own worlds, lightyears away from this forlorn universe.

&quot;Alright, let&#39;s practice your slide,&quot; Morgan says, and I nod. I make another drink and then slide it $mhis way, watching it with my lips pressed together as it swerves too much to the right and hits the ground, breaking and spilling.

“I haven’t tried to, not that I’ve been in one since then. I keep telling myself that some people are just that way, it’s not me, it’s them. I shouldn’t lump everyone up together because of what one person did. Whether I do or not, I don’t know.” $mHe takes another long sip of $mhis drink, shrugging. We both drink silently for a while, neither of us looking at the other. We were in our own worlds, lightyears away from this forlorn universe.

&quot;Alright, let&#39;s practice your slide,&quot; Morgan says, and I nod. I make another drink and then slide it $mhis way, watching it with my lips pressed together as it swerves too much to the right and hits the ground, breaking and spilling. We both stare at it, neither of us saying anything at first.

&quot;Um ... I&#39;ll make you another one,&quot; I say with a small chuckle.

&quot;Yea, and this time how about you just place it in front of me. We can practice the slide more when I get,&quot; $mhe looks down at the broken glass, &quot;plastic cups.&quot; I pour both of us a shot while $mhe cleans up the mess and after carefully clinking the small glasses, gulp it down.

“I never thought about it until it happened to me, but I agree. I’ve wondered what my reaction would be if they broke up with me another way. If they just told me that they never felt that way. It would hurt, but I would’ve been okay.” We both drink silently for a while, neither of us looking at the other. We were in our own worlds, lightyears away from this forlorn universe.

“Well, I think you’re pretty amazing, Morgan, and anybody would be lucky to have you and stupid to let you go.” Morgan’s peachy cheeks shift in its tone, a light pink overtaking them. The blush compliments $mhim in ways that I haven’t noticed with others. It causes me to smile, which only deepens $mhis blush more.
		
“Compliments will not win you a promotion.”
		
“I guess if that were my main purpose, then I’d be kinda upset. But seeing that it’s not, and I meant what I said, not really.” Morgan’s eyes soften before $mhe turns $mhis gaze away from me. $mHe clinks $mhis

Sydero fiddles with the key in her palm, turning it over again and again in her hand. This was perhaps the fifth time that she has studied it. There was no real reason she was doing it, just something to focus on while her mind had a field day.

[[Continue-&gt;W2_1]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="680" name="W2_1" tags="" position="2785,2702" size="100,100">The sudden vibrating sensation in her pocket causes her to jump, a feeling she wasn’t used to at all. She hated that Bradley made her actually use this thing. She felt that at any moment someone would track her down, despite Bradley’s reassurance.

“Hello?” she answers, sighing when she heard the familiar aristocratic and whiny voice of her current client.

“I do hope you’re actually performing the duties that //I// paid you for, instead of thinking about skipping out.” Sydero closes her eyes and counts, a habit that she has been forced to take on since talking with the man yesterday morning.

“I’m about to do it now, shut up and keep your pants on.” Before she could receive a reply, she hangs up, leaving the shelter of the stolen car and approaching the tall building. As she walks towards the building, she checks her phone, nodding at the text from Bradley that states the cameras were now off.

“What are you doing here?” the first security guard that she came across asks. 

“None of your business, just sleep,” she tells him. The man’s eyes glazed over, and he swayed from one side to the next, finally falling out of his chair and to the ground. Her pace never slowed. She made it to the elevator and took it up, waiting impatiently as a short annoying jingle plays overhead.

The elevator doors part and two bewildered guards meet her. They hurl questions at her, their hands shakily moving to their tasers.

“Hey, what about you both shut up,” she shouts. They quiet down, but only because they are shocked by her audacity. “Any of you know where room 632 is?” They both pipe up at the same time, one questioning her intentions and the other questioning her presence and identity.

“Ugh, both of you just sleep.” Similar to the other, both men drop to the floor immediately, their bodies creating a loud thud against the ceramic tile flooring. Sydero finds her own way, going from hall to hall to find the appropriate room. Upon finding it she shows herself in, seeing a middle-aged man busy at his desk. The office was large and attractive, but empty. She saw great potential; too bad it wouldn’t come by his hand.

[[Continue-&gt;W2_2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="681" name="W2_2" tags="" position="2887,2702" size="100,100">“Mr. Douglas? Congratulations, on the promotion,” she begins, walking in and casually taking a seat as if she was invited. The man peers from her to the now closed door, and then around the office as if it had a clue as to why this stranger had abruptly entered.

“Um, who are you?”

“Unimportant. Back to the promotion, how’d you get it?”

“I’m calling security.” This part, Sydero was used to. No one was okay with a random stranger, dressed in black, casually walking into their office when the building is closed. She would be bothered if the man didn’t threaten her with such words. That didn’t mean she wouldn’t appreciate someone who just cooperated. The man picks up his phone, shrieking in horror when Sydero flings it across the room with one flick of her wrist. This dance that her targets chose to do always left a sour taste in her mouth.

“You see, there are some people in this building, namely a man two doors down with a rod up his ass, who don’t think you deserve it. They want to walk into work tomorrow and see your dead body, suicide style.” The man swallows the lump in his throat, shaking profusely. She could probably work on her delivery.

&lt;&lt;if $sympathy &gt;= 50&gt;&gt;\
	She could practically hear Roe in her ear now, scolding her for not knowing how to speak to others, even if those moments were their final hours. She wasn’t entirely against Roe asserting $himself into the conversation, it meant she could get to business while Roe gathered information.
	
	//A nice team dynamic//, she found herself thinking, scolding herself for such thoughts immediately. She needed no one. She deserved no one.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	Though Roe would probably disagree with that thought, $he would say that she was doing a fantastic job. She could practically see Roe leaning up against the wall, trying to stay calm and collected, while at the same time seem like the poster $boy for badasses everywhere. The thought brought a reluctant smile to her face. But she quickly scolds herself, she needs to focus.

Donovan just got here a month ago and thinks he deserves it all.” Douglas pounds his fist on the table, upsetting some of the more sensitive items there. An interesting revelation though, especially since her current employer made it out as if //he// was the one that deserved it. Despite her general distaste of the man, and his willingness to kill an innocent man simply because he was greedy, Sydero had little choice. She was getting paid to introduce the man in front of her to death.

“Nothing personal.”

“Stay away from me!” he shouts, grabbing the nearest item which happened to be a lamp. She raises her hands in mock surrender, flashing her hands open and somehow causing the window to begin to crack.

“Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall.” Douglas shakes his head, putting the lamp down as he drops to his knees to beg. “Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.” The glass cracked further.

“I’ll do anything! I’ll pay you!”

“All the king’s men and all the king’s //money//.”

“Anything!” Suddenly, Douglas’s body is flung through the air, crashing into the weakened glass. The pressure finally sends the glass shards tumbling down, and with it, his body joined them. Sydero was able to walk to the window before his body made contact with the ground. Due to the darkness and how high up she was, she could only see a small figure sprawled out on the ground.

“Couldn’t put Humpty together again.”

I slide two beer bottles down the bar, winking at the two patrons that nod at me in thanks. I have little time to celebrate the perfect slide, as another asks for a shot of whiskey. I complete the order and graciously accept the ten-dollar tip. I send a small but satisfied smirk to Mr. Hotshot, who was actually seeing fewer customers than usual, all due to them being on my side of the bar. Sometimes karma took a while, but it always showed its ugly face.

“Nice,” Morgan compliments, jingling $mhis car keys as $mhe approaches, “I’m going to run down to the store, think you can handle everything here?” I know Morgan was taking a liking to me, but I didn’t think $mhe would trust me this much. Especially since Mr. Hotshot was standing right there. He heard the same thing I did and though he doesn’t comment, deflates.

“Yea, I can.” Morgan thanks me and walks off, ultimately leaving me in charge.

The patrons are happy, the bar is stocked, tips are still coming in, I was actually pleased.

“Douglas Stewart was found dead this morning by a janitor arriving at work, it appears that the man jumped out of his sixth-floor window. This comes days after Stewart was given a promotion after working five years with said company. Co-workers are mystified and hurt by the sudden events, stating that the man was the happiest they’ve ever seen him.”

The news-woman switches to other news, news that none of us seem to particularly care for. From behind me, I hear my phone start vibrating, the new one that Bradley had given me anyway. I check the caller-ID to see that it’s Bradley himself.

“What!?”

“Exact same thing I said when I saw it.”

“Bradley, I’m not joking, what are you talking about?”

“Watch the video.” He hangs up without further explaining himself, a second later a video is sent to my phone. I grab my headphones and sit on a nearby barstool to watch it.

	The camera focuses on what I recognize is the Arlington bank. And even with that black cliché mask hiding $his face, I instantly recognize the person behind it. Me. 

	“Virginia police are on the lookout for a dangerous criminal who has robbed the Arlington Bank yesterday morning. During a deadly shootout, two officers from the Arlington County Police Department have lost their lives. Cameras place this person,” my heart drops as an image of me appears on the screen, “$name Roe, at the scene, along with an accomplice that has yet to be identified.” This was impossible; obviously I hadn’t done this.

	The camera focuses on what looks to be Chris’s house, or at least his parent’s house. I had gone over to it a handful of times.

	“After a home invasion gone wrong, and a deadly shootout with cops, four deaths have taken place today in the home of Lisa and Troy Richardson. The bodies have been identified as two officers from the Arlington County Police Department, and homeowner Troy Richardson along with his son, Chris Richardson. The discovery was made by the lady of the house, Lisa, who came home to the bloody and disastrous scene.”

	The camera shifts to Mrs. Richardson sniffling, attempting to speak. “I came home to it, I ... I’m sorry, I can’t.” The video returns to the news reporter whose acting skills were far better than her reporting.

	“An eyewitness places this person,” my heart drops as an image of me appears on the screen, “$name Roe, at the scene during the crime.” This was impossible; obviously I hadn’t done this. The video continues, another man on camera.

	“I just saw $him walking towards the house with a gun, screaming about something. $He looked pissed off, that’s when I called the police.” The man continues to speak about what he thinks he saw, but my brain is hardly keeping up. According to them, I killed my best friend. And not only that but Mrs. Richardson believed it, she believed that //I// was the one who did this to her family. I wasn’t even factoring how much trouble I was about to be in with the law, regardless of if I was there or not.

The video stops there, but I’m still staring down at it, as if re-watching. I was now a wanted criminal, guilty of crimes I did not do. It wasn’t hard to figure out how my name was smeared in the first place. Somehow Langston was able to copy my appearance. I don’t know how that works with shapeshifters, but it was the only thing that made any sense.

You okay?” one of the patrons ask, and though I feel my head go up and down, I hardly understand why. My eye shoots up to the television that was still on the news channel, and I turn it immediately, we were in another state, but this happened all the time. Police would tell all surrounding states to be on high alert.

Raum did this to root me out? But what if the police actually got to me before he did?

Everyday something else was tacked on. One day it’s me running from werewolves, the next I’m about to become a faerie sacrifice, and now, I’m running away from the law. Just once, I need my life to not slap me across the face. I need it to pat my head and tell me that everything will be okay.

I check the time, aware of the growing number of people who were starting to worry about me. It was mid-day, the restaurant wouldn’t close down anytime soon.

I was in danger, but there was no safe place for me to retreat to.

Alright, well that&#39;s the end of my break, it was time to find Sydero again. I don’t know if she can help me when it comes to actual law enforcement, but I know she could keep me safe from Raum. Plus, I’m sure this was the wrong time to be on my own.

I needed to go, luckily Mr. Hotshot was still moping around. I find him and tell him to watch the bar, leaving without answering his questions. I fly down the street, only when I see a police car do I slow down considerably. If I get pulled over for speeding, then that would be it. They would run my license and find that I had a warrant to my name. I drive slowly, obeying every single law of the road until I get to my motel room.
		
The stale cold air hits me, more refreshing than I would typically give it credit for. I need to focus, to take a deep breath in and sort my problems out. To put it all on the table and take a step back, to see where I stand.

I’ll wait until Morgan returns and just tell $mhim that I have a stomach issue. A classic yet always useful lie.
		
Like I predicted, Morgan shows up thirty or so minutes later. Morgan would want a better explanation than ‘my stomach hurt,’ and each minute I spent on my feet was causing me to feel more and more lightheaded. As soon as I see Morgan, I deliver my news and then leave, ignoring $mhim screaming my name. If $mhe decides to fire me, it wouldn’t really mean anything, I was going to have to leave soon anyway.

Donovan glares out the window, at the many cars that sit patiently in the lot, waiting for their owners to return to them. If he angled his gaze down, he would see the reporters and the cameras, all begging to be let in to get a view of the office that would soon be his. He had gotten the call that very morning, telling him that he would be promoted. 

“They’ve been here all day,” he states.

“Well, a man did die,” the feminine voice behind him states blatantly. He turns his back to the window, his eyes landing on the attractive yet highly exasperating woman sitting in front of him.

“I said kill him, not push him out of the damn window,” he scolds, talking in hushed tones though the door was closed.

“Either way, his blood was going to be all over the place,” Sydero points out, playing with the small toy on his desk, “I just made it look like he did it to himself.”

“You disgust me.” Sydero’s hand froze over the toy, and she clenches her jaw, “you’re not much better. Wanting someone dead because they deserved something you didn&#39;t?”

“Take your money and get out,” he grabs the suitcase and throws it at her in disgust, only Sydero’s quick reflexes saving her face. Anger radiated off of her, her insides boiling as she glares at the man.

“Know what your problem is?” Sydero asks, her tone flat, no emotion in it, “your tie is a bit too tight.” She slowly clenches her hand into a fist, watching as his tie tightened around the man’s neck. His eyes widen in realization, he grabs at it, attempting to undo it.

“Stop this.”

“Still giving commands?” Her fist clenches more, so tight that even her fist was beginning to change colors. He gasps for air, clawing at the tie and then clawing at his desk frantically. Finally, his movements cease, his head rolls back and he slumps in his seat. Sydero stares at him for some time. When she finally moves she does it to grab a wipe, wiping the surface of his desk and grabbing the man’s wallet. She takes what she wants before putting it back, leaving the room.

“Nice doing business with you.”

“What happened?” Sydero doesn’t answer him, but not because she chose not to. As soon as she stops, her breathing quickens as if she could not breathe. She wavers in her spot, Bradley supporting her by instinct, though he wished to be as far away from her as possible. Her eyes met his, and he immediately glances away. Crimson veins race towards her pupil, creating thin bridges across the amber ocean.

“Uh, did you hear about $name?”

“About Roe being a criminal? Yea, who would’ve guessed,” she smirks, her eyes causing her to appear more malicious than usual.

“Maybe we should –,” Bradley begins nervously, but Sydero quickly stops him.

“$He wanted to go and $he got it. It’s no longer my problem.” Bradley opens his mouth to reply, but Sydero was already getting into the car and closing the door. He was unsure if he wanted to get in with her, not when he was hesitant about what her multicolored eyes could mean. There was only one memory he dreaded more than seeing his parent’s lifeless bodies, and that was the one of those werewolves who had killed them. He wanted them to pay, but the way in which they did, by Sydero’s hands no less, he wasn’t sure even they deserved that.

“Let’s go, Bradley!” Sydero barks and he comes out of his stupor. He could only hope. In any case, he wasn’t worried about himself as much as he was concerned about $name.

		“Bust a vein or did an organ stop working?”

		“No.”

		“Did anything that was going to end your life come up?”

		I knew where this was going, and I was done playing the game, “no.”

		“Then I don’t know why you left.”

“I refuse to accept it.”

“Why are you acting like this? Why not just tell me what’s going on? I can help.” Upon hearing help, I shake my head furiously. Morgan gives me a pleading look. It was nice to know that $mhe wanted to help, but the problem wasn’t something $mhe could fix, that and $mhe wouldn’t believe me.

“Look, I’m sorry I walked into your restaurant that day, that was my fault.

I gaze around the restaurant, mostly because I was thinking of a way to tell Morgan that this would be my last day. Most of the time you handed in a two-week notice, not a two minute one. I open my mouth to tell $mhim of my plans when there’s a harsh knock on the main doors.

“Hold that thought,” Morgan tells me, leaving my side to go see who it is. I go with $mhim, only to see one of the kitchen staff waving awkwardly from the other side. $mHe rolls $mhis eyes but opens the door, playfully tapping the man upside his head.

“Why didn’t you just come in through the back?”

“Well, that would’ve been even more work,” the man starts. His skin suddenly becomes overwhelmingly wrinkly, sagging off of him as if it didn’t fit properly. “And no fun.” I take a step back. The stench of rotting flesh and putrid fumes attacks my nose as the skin falls off of him, folding on itself. It plops to the ground in a puddle of slime and what appears to be mucus. A viscous secretion still cliinging to the man as his skin begins to stretch back in place.

“What the hell?” Morgan questions.

&lt;&lt;if $showec&gt;&gt;\
	I turn in my spot and push Morgan onto the bed, straddling $mhis lap as soon as $mhe hits the bed. My mouth bears down on $mhis in an instant, both hands leaving to explore every curve that $mhis body has to offer. My inquisitive hands wander down to $mhis legs, putting just enough pressure to get a rise out of $mhim. I smile at the moan that leaves $mhis lips, prompting me to further my venture. There was something about exploring a body that was still reasonably strange to me. Morgan wasn&#39;t a complete stranger, of course, but $mhe wasn&#39;t familiar to me either. We hadn&#39;t talked for days on end, totally enraptured with one another. But we also hadn&#39;t randomly met up, our eyes meeting in a barely lit club with alcohol and adrenaline propelling us closer to one another.

	And yet, at that moment, I didn&#39;t care.

	I pull back, my hands working on $mhis shirt and then $mhis pants. In no time $mhe rests before me, $mhis body on display for me to admire and caress the way I saw fit.

	&quot;Get back down here,&quot; $mhe smirks, looping $mhis hands around my neck, while $mhis other hand held onto mine tenderly. I oblige, but at the last minute, I avoid $mhis mouth. My lips instead go to $mhis jaw where I rest delicate kisses, trailing them down $mhis neck and to $mhis chest. My hand trails up and down $mhis body, circling my finger along $mhis inner thigh.

	$mHis warmth envelops me like a warm blanket on a chilly day, escape inevitable and the farthest thing from my mind. I attempt to calm my mind, but it&#39;s no use. It jumps from sensation to sensation. It would focus on Morgan&#39;s warmth before delving into the feeling of $mhis wet lips against mine. And then shift to $mhis wandering hands and their placement. I bury my nose into $mhis neck, taking a deep breath in before delivering a few playful nips.

	&quot;Want to stop … being a tease?&quot; $mhe questions, $mhis hips jerking upwards and meeting mine, begging for what I have yet to give.

	&quot;I&#39;ll think about it boss,&quot; I grin, wanting to know if calling $mhim that would get the rise I expect to get. It does. Morgan groans as the words leave my mouth, bringing my mouth back to $mhis and kissing me urgently.

	&quot;Want to start being patient?&quot; I question, nibbling on $mhis ear once I pull back. Morgan tugs at my clothes and I indulge $mhis actions, letting $mhim tear the clothes off of me. As soon as the last article has been pulled away, our bodies meet.
	
	&lt;&lt;if $mgender is &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;\
		I work my way down her body, nipping and sucking at her soft skin, reacting off of her small cues. I kiss the inner part of her thigh as I insert two fingers into her, smirking as her hips rise partly off the bed, and she whimpers my name as I speed up. Our bodies meet time and time again on that bed, working up a sweat as we keep the pace going. The motel room is filled with the sounds of us together and our bodies joining countless times. The heat surrounding the room rising as we pick up the pace, and our hearts race.
	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
		I work my way down his body, nipping and sucking at his skin, taking my time to admire how specific muscles ripple in pleasure. I kiss the inner part of his thigh as I take his member into my hand, my pace slow, before speeding up, teasing him whenever I saw fit. Each time he complains, I change up my tactic, enjoying the way his hips buck. Our bodies meet time and time again on that bed, working up a sweat as we keep the pace going. The motel room is filled with the sounds of us together and our bodies joining time and time again. The heat surrounding the room rising as our actions pick up the pace, and our hearts race.
	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	I turn in my spot and push Morgan onto the bed, straddling $mhis lap as soon as $mhe hits the bed. My mouth bears down on $mhis, both hands leaving to explore every curve that $mhis body has to offer. My hands wander down $mhis legs, putting just enough pressure to get a rise out of $mhim. I smile at the moan that leaves $mhis lips, prompting me to further my venture. Our bodies clash together, and we find our rhythm at the same time. The heat surrounding the room rising as our actions pick up the pace, and our hearts race.

	I allow Morgan to push me down onto the bed, feeling part of $mhis weight settle onto me as $mhe straddles my lap. $mHis mouth bears down on mine, both hands leaving my chest to explore every curve that my body had to offer. I shiver at $mhis touch, cold hands running across warm skin, soon joined by a warm and wet mouth. $mHis hands wander towards my legs, adding just enough pressure to cause an impatient moan to slip past my lips. I push my body closer to $mhis, whimpering when $mhe chuckles and pulls back further.

	$mHis warmth envelops me like a warm blanket on a chilly day, escape inevitable and the farthest thing from my mind. I attempt to calm my mind, but it&#39;s no use. It jumps from sensation to sensation. It would focus on Morgan&#39;s warmth before delving into the feeling of $mhis wet lips against mine, leaving trails from my neck to my abdomen. And then, it shifts to $mhis wandering hands and their placement.

	&quot;Teasing? Seriously?&quot; I question and sigh inwardly, the warmth of $mhis body being so close leaving as $mhe sits up.

	&quot;Or maybe I just want a rise out of you,&quot; $mhe mumbles in my ear, gently nipping at my earlobe. $mhe pulls back and begins to work on getting rid of both of our clothes, throwing them to the side. As soon as the last article has been torn away, our bodies meet. Clashing together. We find our rhythm at the same time. The heat surrounding the room rising as our actions pick up the pace, and our hearts race.

		She wraps her arms around my neck, kissing me frantically as if suddenly, she could no longer control herself. She rocked her hips against mine, making circular motions, slowing down, and speeding up. I hold her close and let her set the pace, my only job to keep up. Each time she speeds up, her nails rake across my back and my chest, not putting too much pressure to leave marks, but enough to make me growl and whimper. I twist my fingers in her hair, yanking her head down to meet my lips as she continues her movement. The heat of the room rising with each rock, with each moan, and finally descends with both of our climaxes.
	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
		He wraps his arms around my neck, kissing me frantically as if suddenly, he could no longer control himself. While his lips are busy claiming mine, his fingers toy with me. Rubbing up against my sensitive parts, promising more with every second. Each time his hand movement quickens, my nails rake across his back, not enough pressure to leave marks, but enough to make him growl. He finally stops, giving me a look that said he was done with all forms of foreplay. I nod breathlessly. The heat of the room rises with each stroke, with each moan, and finally descends with both of our climaxes.

It had to be Chris, but why would Chris tell $mhim? Regardless, I open the door, and Morgan shoots into the motel, turning to me in anger.

&lt;&lt;if $leftwork&gt;&gt;\
	“I had something come up.”
	
	“Did you pee on yourself?” I wrinkle my nose and furrow my brow, not knowing why that was the next question.

	“No.”

	“Bust a vein or did an organ stop working?”

	“No.”

	“Did anything that was going to end your life come up?”

	I knew where this was going, and I was done playing the game, “no.”

	“Then I don’t know why you left.”
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“I didn’t just disappear, I waited till you got back before leaving.”

	“You know what I mean $fname!” $mhe voices angrily, “what the hell was that? And why are you staying in a motel? Do you not live here?”
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
	
“I don’t have to explain myself to you,” I tell $mhim wishing $mhe’d just leave so I can think over all of this in silence. I need a plan and hearing $mhim scream at me about something that was no longer relevant, was not helping.

“Actually, you do because see, I’m your boss.”

“The hell, $name?”
			
“What did I do? Besides leave you stranded at work, sorry for that by the way,” I say glumly, knowing I would have to tell Chris soon.

“That’s exactly what you did. Morgan comes up to me screaming as if $mhe has the right, and questioning me about you. What happened and why didn’t you tell me you were just suddenly taking off?”

“Bradley texted me.” I grab my phone, bringing up the video before handing it over to Chris. I sit back patiently, watching his face as he watches the entirety of it. His reaction was similar to my own, even after finishing the video his eyes still grace the screen, as if waiting for someone to tell him it’s a prank.

“The shapeshifter?” he finally asks, and I nod. The only positive to any of this was that Chris knew I hadn’t done this, unlike when I disappeared in the beginning. Probably one of the only people whose opinion mattered knew the truth and knew I was innocent.

“For once, can we get good news?” Chris asks, handing me back the phone, “what are you going to do? What are we going to do?”

[[“We need to find Sydero.”]]

Chris takes a step back, attempting to leave my hug but I’m unable to let him go. I shake my head and finally move, shaking my head even more as I look deep into his eyes.

“No … you’re coming with us,” I tell him, and his eyes widen in shock but also happiness.

“What!” Sydero shouts from near the car, her eyes showing the exact opposite, “no, he’s taking his ass and getting on that bus.”

“I can’t just send him off, Sydero. I thought I could, but I can’t.” She waves my words away as if they an annoying fly that refused to leave her be.

“All I’m hearing is ‘I want to see my friend get killed too.” Chris, on the bus now.”

Chris glances at me, and I roll my eyes, “you’ll learn to ignore her.”

“No, he won’t. Because he’s leaving!” she says, pronouncing the word leaving very slowly, treating me as if I was deaf. I guide him back to the car, telling the bus to go ahead and leave. Judging by the look in Sydero’s eye, if anyone wanted to get on the bus and disappear, it’s her.

“Someone, be kind to me and just run me over, not once, multiple times,” she grumbles loud enough for us to hear. She starts the car back up, and Chris and I get in as she gets back on the road, driving off.

	“And you think she can help? Believe me, I think this is a smart move but only because I feel like we need protection.” That part was true as well. Raum was after us, and we now had to watch our back when it came to law enforcement, additional eyes would count.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“We need to find Sydero, this is going to be too big for us.”
	
	“And you think she’ll actually help us? After we just took off like we did?” It was a good question, one I didn’t have the answer to. Sydero wasn’t above keeping this over my head, and I could practically hear her chirping in my ear about how we got what we wanted. But there was no other way, we needed her. Raum was after us, and we now had to watch our back when it came to law enforcement, additional eyes were needed.

	Morgan and I rest beside one another, our bodies as close as can get, our arms wrapped around one another. To an outsider, we probably looked like any other couple. My mind vaguely reminds me of the rules set up around one-night stands, rule number one being to avoid cuddling. Yet, at the moment, I couldn’t care less. Thoughts that typically haunt me are kept away. For those handful of minutes, nothing else existed but Morgan and me, and pleasure.
	
	I smirk at the thought, absentmindedly reaching over and kissing $mhis forehead. Of course, $mhe was asleep at the moment, cuddling further into my embrace. I allow my eyes to close, and for the first time in a long time, my sleep is peaceful and pleasant.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	After Morgan leaves, I collapse onto my bed, wishing the world would disappear. I suppose sleeping would soon solve that issue though. All the problems that I was facing, I’d save them for tomorrow $name, right now, I need quiet sleep.

	The next morning is filled with Morgan rushing around and me enjoying every second of it. Morgan was still trying to get prepared for the day, though I’m not sure $mhe knew that $mhe was still without a shirt.
	
	“Shit, where are my keys?” $mhe panics and I dangle them in front of $mhis face.
	
	“Are you always this way after a good night or am I just lucky?” $mhe snatches the keys from me and gives me a toothy grin, rushing me out of the motel.
	
	“I refuse to be late because of you,” $mhe says playfully, planting a soft wet kiss on the back of my neck.
	
	“Keep doing things like that, and we might not make it to work at all,” I tease. I go to my car as Morgan goes to $mhis. I wait till $mhe leaves before following behind him.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	The next day I hurry to get ready for what is to be my last day. The pay period ends today, and so I would at least get paid for the hours I worked leading up to this. That was enough, especially since I had money from tips.
		
	I rush out of the motel, putting my things in the car since I didn’t exactly know if I’d be back. I check out and then head towards the restaurant.

He shakes his head, freeing himself from his current thoughts and turns to head back. What’s done is done, he couldn’t change that. But he was curious as to why $name left work in the first place. And though the last thing he wanted to do was talk to her, his curiosity always won out in the end.

	“You know what? Fuck you, Chris! You know me better than that and that I would never agree to that just for some dumb job. Have you forgotten that bartending was on both of our resumes?” My anger continues to rise, not only because of what he insinuates but because I was starting to realize that this would never be. A fact I knew but decided to ignore more often than not. Chris wasn’t worried about who I was messing around with, but the reason and how it affected him.

	Chris raises his hands as if surrendering, he goes into the bathroom and comes out a minute later in workout clothes.

	“I’m going for a jog,” he tells me, speedily leaving the motel before I can say anything more.

	Chris slams the door behind him, far more harshly than he intended. But a large piece of him didn’t care. He stuck one of his earbuds in and began to jog. The sun was setting so this jog would have to be a short one. He had half a mind to just go sit in the car, but that would only make matters worse. He’d go sit in $name’s car and smell $him, inevitably he’d start thinking about $him, and that was the last thing he wanted.

	He definitely didn’t want to think about $him in //that// way. This just means that there was nothing between them, right? That everything Chris thought he was experiencing really wasn’t happening. That thought should bring him some relief, but it did the opposite. He felt as if a pit was opening inside of him, one that was feeding off of his denial.
	
	“$name is not my type,” Chris says aloud as he runs, perhaps hearing the words would add truth. “$name&#39;s my best friend. Anything I&#39;m feeling is because of that.” He repeats the words over and over, trying to get himself to believe the words. Failing.

	“So, why’d you leave early? Something happen?”

	“Bradley texted me.” I grab my phone, bringing up the video before handing it over to Chris. I sit back patiently, watching his face as he watches the entirety of it. His reaction was similar to my own, even 
after finishing the video his eyes still grace the screen, as if waiting for someone to tell him it’s a prank.

The man that stands there is Langston. At his feet rests the most recent skin that he shed, and I can’t help but wonder if my skin went through the same thing. Casually molted and then left on the ground to be disposed of in unsanitary ways. The thought is more than just disturbing. I can feel the bile rise and threaten to expel itself.

“What did you do to Burt!” Morgan screams, pulling me back into the moment. Tears run down $mhis eyes as $mhe faces off against Langston. 

“Morgan, get out of here,” I tell $mhim, grabbing $mhis shoulders and yanking $mhim backward. I don’t know what $mhe thought $mhe just saw, but reality was ten times worse than anything $mhis mind could conjure up.

Langston smiles at me and then follows my gaze to the skin. “Oh, I know what you’re thinking, yea. Your skin was disposed of properly, burnt it while we watched the news slander your name for those crimes. One of the best gigs in my career,” he snorts, “let me tell ya.”

“Isn’t that what your ex-wife used to do?” Petri questions, just now shaking off the minor injury I had given him.

“The dead one? Yea.”

“Get $him,” Raum orders, and suddenly the bar becomes chaotic, everyone rushing towards me.

My ears ring, and I struggle to come out of the drunken like state that I feel I’ve gone into. My face was going to be all types of hurting come tomorrow.

“So, where’s Sydero?”

“I don’t know,” I answer, spitting out a wad of blood that had been gathering in my mouth. I earn a punch for that one, one person holding me to the seat while the other hits.

“This is how this is going to work,” Raum starts, grabbing my chin and forcing me to look at him. My eyes feel heavy, and though I try to concentrate on that evil face, I’m incapable, “you tell us, we kill you. End your misery here.”

“Where’s Sydero, $name?” Raum asks, impatience clinging to his words. Before I can decide on how to answer a question that I’ve already answered, the overhead sprinklers suddenly cut on. Raum and his nameless goons scream in horror as the water strikes them, and I can just barely make out thin trails of dark grey smoke rising from their bodies. Skin lesions appear on the other three, mainly on their faces and arms. If the body part was exposed to the water, it grew a lesion.

“Holy water, bitches!” I hear a childish voice shout. I turn just in time to see Sydero dodging one weak throw after another before plunging a unique blade through one of the demon’s hearts. She slides on the ground, kicking the legs out from another before stabbing him.

“We gotta go,” Petri announces, both him and Langston grabbing Raum as they go. The third demon attempts to follow them, but Sydero trips the man. She drops the knife onto him before stepping on the pommel and driving it deeper into him.

“Oops,” she smiles, turning to face me.

	“Let me see,” she states, and Chris moves the ice away to reveal my face. Whatever she sees isn’t pretty as she grimaces. She snatches the ice cloth from Chris and pulls something out of her bag. In her hands is a green candle, which she soon lights.

“So, what was that stuff coming down from the sprinklers?” I question.

“Holy water,” she answers, “not really hard to pull off. Find the water source for the bar and bless it, simple. No demon can stand the stuff. Some of the stronger ones can’t be stopped by it, but it’s still a nuisance to them.” Silence engulfs us, the only true sound coming from Bradley’s fingers as they race across his laptop keyboard. The gas station is unnaturally quiet as well, only two people are pumping gas, and three cars, not including ours, rest in the lot.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	She nudges me and grabs Chris’s attention, “we should go. I want to put as much space between Raum and us. I’m sure he’s not happy about that holy water bath we gave him.” We both nod in agreement and head towards the car.

	&lt;&lt;if $SRomance &gt;= 3&gt;&gt;\
		“Roe,” Sydero begins, stopping me before I get into the car. “Next time you just want to go off and do your own thing, don’t.”

		“Aw, was life boring without me, Syd?”

		“I wouldn’t say boring, but I would say that something vital felt like it was missing.” I raise a brow, it was indirect but perhaps the nicest thing I’ve heard her say about me, &quot;I&#39;m referring to your car.&quot; She sneers and disappears inside said car. I was having an issue with trying to figure out if she was being honest or not.

The outside world soars by, tree after tree, building after building, and field after field. The windows are rolled down just enough to where the country air stings my face. I can feel every bump that the car goes over and every dip that it makes. It was a rhythmic sound that threatens to put me to sleep.

But I can see darkness on the horizon, creeping closer, getting braver.

	“Sure, because I’ve always wanted to be slapped across some backyard ring by a supernatural creature,” he murmurs, taking it.

“We stay off the radar until I can figure out how to solve our biggest issue, your warrant,” Sydero answers, picking up a throw pillow and hitting it against the wall violently. Dust immediately flees the pillow, escaping to the air. “Also, Raum keeps finding us, and I would like to know how.”

“Not another cleansing,” I whimper, but she doesn’t answer. I doubt she even hears me, her eyes focused on the sofa in front of her.

The sun was still out, and I wasn’t quite ready to go to sleep yet, my curiosity peaked on this new place.

[[Nevermind, I’m going to bed.-&gt;ER2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="763" name="Explore the surrounding area." tags="" position="55,3312" size="100,100">I head out towards the woods, finding that I spend quite a lot of time in them. By the end of the year, I’ll be able to name the individual trees that I come across. The thought gets my mind off of the real issues at hand though, but that was the thing, there was always issues. For just once I wish to relax. And not for a couple of minutes, for much longer. To go to sleep and then wake up the next day knowing I had nothing to worry about.
	
I walk further, keeping my eye on the direction of the house. Unlike the other two forests that have embedded themselves in my mind, this forest is lively. Deer graze ahead of me, unbothered by my presence. Squirrels dash across the forest ground, fighting for the acorn that one has and the other wishes to possess. Birds chirp from their nests, calling for their mate to return. This was perhaps the type of house where you sat on the porch and listened to grasshoppers as fireflies dance before you.
	
Other than trees, plants, and bushes, I find a well behind the house along with three clothing lines. I also find Bradley typing away on his computer on the back porch.
		
[[“I don’t think that’s what they mean when they say get some air.”]]

[[“How’s the project going?”]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="764" name="Explore the house." tags="" position="201,3312" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;set $explorehouse = true&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
I decide to explore the house, especially since three rooms were waiting to be claimed. I want the cleanest one or whichever one had the best bed, I deserve it. I place choosing a room on the back burner for now, wandering into the kitchen. Sydero’s words were making more sense, her saying that this was her main safehouse. A small round table sits in the middle of the room with a dead flower sitting in a dirty vase. A house’s common appliances rest along the far wall, each covered with dust and dirt but otherwise seem fully functional.
		
There’s no food in the refrigerator, and I’m shocked to find that the inside is relatively clean besides a few splotches of mold, nothing a simple spray of bleach wouldn’t clean up. There is food in the cabinets though, cans and jars of non-perishable items.
	
I leave the kitchen and go to the first room I find on the bottom level. The room is large and barely decorated. It contains a table pushed up against the far wall and a bed on the wall closest to the door. There’re no sheets on the bed, just a stained mattress. Despite the appearance, the mattress is relatively soft. I had a blanket that I could cover it with and could use my bag or mounds of clothes as a pillow if need be.
		
I venture to the other rooms, finding that the setup for each was pretty much the same. I claim the second room that I saw. It was the cleanest room out of the three. After declaring the room mine, I check out the bathroom, and then the spare room upstairs. It’s the most decorated room I’ve seen so far, but I couldn’t officially admire it due to Sydero. She sits near the window, appearing as if she was meditating.

I’m about to walk into the room when the door suddenly closes, almost slamming me in the face. The message was loud and clear, and I turn to walk away.

	A yawn escapes me. The perfect signal for me to go ahead and retire for the day. I grab my bags and head to the room that I had previously chosen.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	A yawn escapes me. The perfect signal for me to go ahead and retire for the day. I grab my bags and pick a room, the cleanest room that I can find. The mattress is stained but otherwise quite nice, softer than even the motel’s mattress.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

At first, I’m unable to sleep. A problem I was seeing more of with each passing night. I was starting to feel like a drifting spirit, watching myself from across the room and feeling some sort of pity for the restless figure. Most nights insomnia became my only companion, but this night was different.

The walls seem to close in on me, and the darkness creeps forward. Feelings that I haven’t felt since I was a child cause me to glance from one side of the room to the other. Despite the heat, I shiver profusely. Movement in the corner catches my eye, and my eyes wander to the corner in question. I see a figure, but once my eyes have focused, nothing rests there. An uncomfortable pit opens in my mind, spitting out nightmarish ideas about what could exist in this house.

The only reason such thoughts don’t keep me up is because exhaustion takes over, my body still trying to catch up on much-needed rest. My senses begin to dim, and I can no longer fight the struggle of keeping my eyes open. As everything slows, I swear I hear someone whisper goodnight to me.

The next morning I’m woken up by the light streaming into my room, nothing else. Checking the time, I find that it’s eleven o’clock and – my phone is charging. My phone was charging! I jump out of bed and hit the lights, watching as one of the bulbs immediately blow out, but the other is on. Excitement at the possibilities come to mind.

“What are you doing?”

“I’m just curious.”
						
“You guys are still feuding, and if not feuding then there’s still some tension.

He immediately thought the worst, when he could have easily said he didn’t know what I was talking about.

I need a shower, something that I was able to take frequently and didn’t want to stop. The bathroom wasn’t attractive, in fact, it was downright disgusting which is why I refuse to get in barefoot. Perhaps there was a store nearby, we could go grab some items to improve living conditions here.
		
I take a long warm shower, getting out and heading towards the kitchen, hoping to run into the others.

I do this numerous times, behaving as a caveman would when they first discovered the wonders of fire. Perhaps I even mirrored their excitement, glancing from the light switch to the overhead light as if some sort of god. The action gets boring rather quickly, though my smile never wavers due to my childishness and the fact that we now had light. After growing bored, I head towards the kitchen, hoping to run into the others.

Hopefully, my uncle would pick up, he never liked picking up calls from unknown numbers.
		
&quot;Hello?&quot; my uncle asks in a skeptical tone.
		
&quot;Uncle Matheus!&quot; I say, pure joy in my tone at the sound of his voice.

&quot;Well damn, $name, is that you?&quot;

&quot;Yea, it&#39;s me. Make sure you save this number by the way.&quot;

&quot;Forget the number, how are you? I thought you were dead or something! Do you know that you&#39;re wanted by the cops? They came by to question me about where you&#39;re at. They have literally been stalking me. As if me saying no is just me really saying, &#39;yea, follow me around to see if $he will magically appear.&#39;&quot;

&quot;Have you been threatened at all?&quot;

&quot;No. I&#39;ve been at home for a while. But who gives a crap? How are you? What&#39;s going on? What have you been up to?&quot; 

&lt;&lt;if $uncleknows&gt;&gt;\
	I go ahead and fill in my uncle as best as I can, recounting everything that comes to mind. It was a good thing that I had already told him about the supernatural, it made narrating that much easier. I didn&#39;t have to pause and hastily change part of the story.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	I go ahead and fill in my uncle as best as I can, having to go slow since he didn&#39;t know about the supernatural. I change some things around and entirely leave out other parts, like the faeries.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
		
Once I&#39;ve told him everything, he changes the subject, speaking about other things before I have to say goodbye. Being on the phone with him too long is probably unwise anyway. I promise to text or call and say my farewell. Once I&#39;m off the phone, I head downstairs and towards the kitchen. Hopefully, I would run into the others.

Bradley, on the other hand, sits at the table with an untouched granola bar close by. His attention is on his laptop, and three open energy drinks rest nearby.

“Two energy drinks already?” I question in shock; the kid could outdo some college students I know.

“Naw, two were drunk last night. I have to drink smart, or I’ll run out quickly,” Bradley tells me, but I was stuck on his first group of words. He drunk two of these last night. Sydero must have seen the look on my face because she clears her throat.

“Bradley didn’t sleep last night.”

“I never sleep. All-day Insomnia Squad!” he shouts, both fists shooting to the sky.

“What were you doing then?” I ask, guessing the answer.

“You’ve seen the electricity? All me, baby. I was up-all-night hacking into the power, and the meters of the nearest building, which thank god is a large building. I was able to redirect some of it here and so here we are. I introduced them to some malware that should be quiet enough to be overlooked, they’ll never know as long as we don’t try to throw some electricity party.” Well, I was impressed.
&lt;&lt;if $shower&gt;&gt;\
	
	“Well, my body thanks you. That shower was the best thing to ever happen to me,” I say, nodding at him with a wide smile.
	
	“Our noses thank you as well,” Sydero jokes, grinning widely at the glare I send her.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

I look over our food options, deciding on ...

		Chris enters a few minutes after, mumbling a good morning to me though he gives everyone else a warm and loud greeting. I watch him with a tinge of anger seeping in, Sydero walking up to me.
		
		“Did I miss something?” she asks, a wide smirk on her face.

		“He’s mad at me,” I mumble, trying not to look bothered by it. I know why he was upset, though I thought he would have let it go by now. Especially upon remembering the fate that Morgan was dealt.

		“You guys are just adorable,” she snorts, unimpressed, “once you’re done meet me outside. Let’s go smart guy.” Almost like a robot, Bradley stands with his laptop in his hands and follow behind Sydero. I realize far too late what Sydero had just done. I stare at Chris and he at his granola bar. I don’t know what to say, if there was even anything //to// say.
		
		I open my mouth numerous times to say something but nothing but wasted air comes out. I end up giving up, not seeing the point of continuing. I leave, going outside to meet up with Sydero, and then waiting for him to join.
	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
		Chris enters a few minutes after, greeting us all with a warm good morning. He goes over and grabs a granola bar.
		
		“Are you the one to thank for the power?” Chris asks, tousling Bradley’s hair. Bradley finally pauses what he’s doing, turning to try and punch Chris who is too fast, and prepared. Chris takes a wise step back and laughs, sitting across from him.

		“You’re going to respect me, old man,” Bradley growls.

		“I do. But I also think I’m going to continue teasing you,” he grins, a mouthful of granola.

		“You guys are just adorable,” Syd snorts, unimpressed, “once you’re done meet me outside. Let’s go smart guy.” Bradley gives Chris another warning glare before standing and grabbing his laptop. Chris and I make small conversation, both speaking on our excitement that we finally have electricity.

		After he finishes his granola, we both go outside to meet up with Sydero.
	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“Once you’re done meet me outside. Let’s go, smart guy,” Sydero tells me, saying the last part to Bradley. Almost like a robot, Bradley stands with his laptop in his hands and follows behind Sydero.
	
	After a few more minutes of preparing myself, I go outside to meet up with Sydero.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

Bradley sits on the front porch, hiding under one of the less damaged awnings to avoid the sun. Sydero stands a few feet away, stretching. As I walk towards her, I notice my knife, her blade, and some guns sitting on the ground.

“Um, what’s about to happen?” I question in fear.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“If you’re going to run with me then you need to know how to fight, I can’t keep saving you,” Sydero tells me, finishing the task of wrapping her knuckles. “That includes you, Chris.” She steps forward and hands him a blade, similar to my own.
	
	“Sure, because I’ve always wanted to be slapped across some backyard ring by a supernatural creature,” he murmurs, taking it.
	
	“Bradley, how about you?” she shouts to the boy who seems to have melded into the darkness, looking five times more mysterious than usual.

	“Does it look like this wimpish body was made for fighting? I’m the smart one, I don’t do fights.”
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\

	“Alright, show me.”

		“Chris, your turn,” Sydero shouts. He groans but takes my spot near Sydero. “$name, stretch. I refuse to have you guys complaining about spraining something.” I do as she suggests while watching them. Chris goes with a simple punch that leaves Sydero laughing, highly unimpressed.
		
		“Seriously? You’re this big, athletic guy, and that’s your best punch?” she questions, he shrugs.
		
		“I’m not really a fan of –”
		
		“I swear, if you say you don’t like hitting girls.”
		
		“No, I was going to say a fan of fighting, period.”
		
		“Well that’s obvious,” she mumbles. She asks him to throw one more punch, this time she approaches him threateningly. He doesn’t actually throw a punch, just sweeps her feet out and put distance between the two of them. She nods and delivers her synopsis, calling me back out there.
	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
		“Chris, your turn,” Sydero shouts. He groans but takes my spot near Sydero. “$name, stretch. I refuse to have you guys complaining about spraining something.” I do as she suggests while watching them. Chris goes with a simple yet powerful punch that leaves Sydero whistling, highly impressed.

		“So, little ol’ Chris actually does have some potential, huh? Been saving that one I’m guessing?” she questions, judging his current stance.

		“Pent up energy.”

		“Yea, sure it is. Might want to find yourself a hobby.”

		“One of these days,” he mumbles. She finishes her examination and delivers her synopsis, calling me back out there.
	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
For the next few hours we train, Sydero showing us multiple offensive and defensive moves and how to do them, as well as helping us to improve our own styles. When she finally allows us to have a break, I forget all about still having to start the weapons part of the training.

She offers me either a gun or a knife.

“You’ll train in both but always rely on the one you’re most comfortable with.”

[[The gun.]]
[[The dagger.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="778" name="Try to recall how Sydero fights." tags="" position="570,3416" size="100,100">Short and choppy images of Sydero fighting come to mind, but nothing concrete. A large percentage of the time, I’m trying not to die when Sydero is fighting so I never really was able to evaluate her. She was fast, that was one thing I recall, and she fights dirty.
			
I suddenly see a blur on the edge of my vision, and I’m too slow to do anything, finding myself on my back and staring up at the clear sky. Sydero’s head comes into my view, and she cocks her head to the side.
			
“What was that? Did you freeze up? Forget your training?”

“I was trying to remember your style,” I growl, getting to my feet.

“That would be great and all if you didn’t decide to do that in the middle of a fight.”

Sydero stands directly in front of me, “to start, I need you to punch me.” I freeze, cocking my head to the side in curiosity and confusion.

“You need me to what?”

“First instinct can say a lot about you and what your fighting style is. So, you get a free hit.” Sydero was really allowing me to get a free hit in, anywhere I like and as hard as I wish for it to be.

I rush towards her ready to throw a punch. My punch gets far but never connects as she throws her left arm up to block, and then sweep it away. As soon as she sweeps it away, her right fist meets my cheek and then her knee comes up and connects with my gut.

I fall to the ground, the pain echoing before subsiding, obviously not Sydero’s top strength.
			
“Nothing wrong with going on the offensive immediately, but only do it if you know you have the advantage.”

Time passes, and it’s evident that both of us are too stubborn to try and attack first. I see her relax, straightening up as she peers at me. Her eyes are searching for something, but what I can’t answer. Suddenly, she runs towards me, and I prepare to throw my first punch, envisioning all possible moves. 

As she comes within range, she moves to the other side, forcing me to throw my punch with my non-dominant arm. The sudden blow is weak, and she easily dodges it and grabs my arm, pinning it behind my back as she forces me to my knees.

“How’d you come up with that?” I question. As soon as my knee hits the ground, she backs away.

“Most of everyone has a dominant side, the side they’re most comfortable with and the side they rely on. Exploit that by forcing them to use their weaker side, and you gain the upper hand.”

Keep it simple and something that can be done quickly, especially since I wasn’t a fan of violence. I approach and throw a quick but effective punch and then push her away. I don’t plan to, at first, but the shove is instinctual. I can see how it would open up more options for me, even if running were one such option.

She stumbles backward due to the shove, and she massages her jaw. Other than these actions, I can’t tell what she is thinking, if she is impressed or if the punch actually was useful in any kind of way.

“So?” I finally question, sick of waiting. And though I didn’t wish to say it aloud, I wanted to know what she thought about said punch. I had put all of my power behind it, and yet she stood before me as if I had only tapped the side of her face playfully.

“Your punch isn’t impressive, but I’m more focused on that shove that came after,” she answers.

“It kinda just happened.”

“Hmm, you started with offense and then immediately performed a defensive move. That shove, especially if done right can buy you more time or even help to subdue if applied with the right moves. I’m going to focus on your reaction and speed.”

“You learned all of that from what I just did?”

“Yep.”

I’m not much of a fighter, and I rather just get her to the ground as soon as possible. But she also wants me to hurt her, so I had to at least add some kind of offensive maneuver to it. Ugh, fighting shouldn’t require all of this thinking, should it?

I decide to just go up to her and do a forward throw. I grab her arm, gripping her wrist and rotating it violently before pushing my back up against her, getting low, and then launching her over my shoulder. I shove her forward so that she skids against the ground and I finally let her go.

I back away and wait for her to get up, but she doesn’t. She stares at the sky, reminding me of people who would just lay on the nice soft grass to cloud gaze. Only this sky didn’t currently hold clouds, and her thoughts seemed on anything but the sky.

“So?” I finally question, sick of waiting. And though I didn’t wish to say it aloud, I wanted to know what she thought about the throw. I pulled it out of nowhere, but I thought it was effective at least.

“Your strength isn’t really awe-inspiring, but the throw itself was amazing,” she compliments, still lying on the ground, “the move you used is typically for defense but the wrist rotating and the forward shove after you threw me, that gave it an offensive touch. Creative too. I’m going to focus on your strength and speed.”

“You learned all of that from me throwing you?”

“Yep.”

Keep it simple and something that I can do easily. I approach her and throw a punch aimed at her cheek. True to her word she doesn’t retaliate. She stumbles backward, massaging her jaw and poking at her cheek.

“So?” I finally question, sick of waiting. And though I didn’t wish to say it aloud, I wanted to know what she thought about said punch. I had put all of my power behind it, and yet she stood before me as if I had only tapped the side of her face playfully.

“You hit harder than I thought,” she snickers, still moving her jaw around, “efficient and a classic move, as well as the standard place to land a punch. Won’t say much for creativity but sometimes simple is nice. I’m going to focus on your strength, accuracy, speed, and punching power.”

I get closer and deliver two quick strikes with my hand flat, a harsh one to the face and then one immediately after to the chest. The last hit has her staggering backward, probing her cheek softly. Other than this action, I can’t tell what she is thinking, if she is impressed or if the strikes actually were effective in any kind of way.
			
“So?” I finally question, sick of waiting. And though I didn’t wish to say it aloud, I wanted to know what she thought about the strikes. I didn’t perform a traditional punch, but I assumed she had just wanted me to hit her based off of instinct.
			
“You’re faster than what I would’ve given you credit for,” she snickers, still massaging her cheek, “effective and an efficient move. From your stance and how quick you moved in to deliver those strikes, I say you’re relying on speed above all. Can’t get hit if your target can’t catch you. Rarely see the style, but I like it. We’re going to work on your speed and accuracy.”

“You learned all of that from that move?”

“Yep.”

My kick range was better and most times, the leg could reach longer than the arm. I was also more confident with my legs than I was with my fists. I approach her quickly and with one foot grounded, I lift the other and aim it towards the outside of her leg, putting all of my strength behind the kick. She drops to her knee and chuckles softly, but that’s it. She doesn’t comment or even look at me as she remains on one knee.

“So?” I finally question, sick of waiting. And though I didn’t wish to say it aloud, I wanted to know what she thought about the kick. I didn’t perform a traditional punch, but I assumed she had just wanted me to hit her based off of instinct.

“You’re creative, I didn’t expect to get kicked,” she snickers, still on her knees, “unorthodox but quick. You definitely rely on your reach and having the advantage of it while your opponent suffers. You need to be quick on your feet, definitely will have to work on strength, balance, and flexibility.”

“You learned all of that from that one move?”

“Yep.”

“Way to weasel yourself out of an answer. The answer is always sub, don&#39;t be a weakling,” he huffs, puffing his cheeks out just like a child. He then marches back down the stairs into his hidden room. Sydero glances at me before following him in, and I follow her, still trying to wrap my head around all of this.

I grab the gun. I want as much space between me and the thing I was attacking, mainly since their speed was inhuman.
		
“Get your ass over here Bradley, you’re going to learn how to use a gun at least,” Sydero barks to the boy who groans instantly.
		
“My complexion and the sun don’t get along.”
	
“Bring your pale vampiric ass over here now!” He reluctantly rises, grabbing a gun and joining us as Sydero sets up targets.
	
“First, make sure your gun is off safety, the ammo is salt rounds so it’s not deadly, though it’ll hurt like hell,” Sydero begins, setting the last target up. “Next, get in a comfortable stance.” She takes us through the different stances and after trying all of them, continues on once we’re ready.
		
“Now load the gun and get a good grip before lining the target up with your sight. The pistol in your hands comes with a front sight tip and rear sight aperture.” I line up the shot.
		
“The more you do this, the better you become. One last thing before you fire, be ready for the recoil. Grip is important to control it, one wrong move and the gun will recoil to the side. Recoil differs based on the gun and the ammo you use, but each gun has it. Don’t fight it, you’ll regret it.” Sydero moves out of the way and motions for us to fire.
		
&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	I keep her words in mind and shoot. I can feel the vibration, and my hands shake, but I do as she says and not fight it. I allow the shake to occur moving only the trigger finger. It takes me a couple tries, but I hit all of my targets with less than ten rounds. Chris, who I knew had shot a gun before, gets his before mine. Bradley is the only one having issues, and as I focus on my own training, Chris and Sydero aid him.
	
	“You’re free, I&#39;ll teach the other weapon later,” she states, waving us away using the edge of her shirt to wipe away the sweat that has collected on her forehead. Chris moves to the side and removes his shirt, stretching as he retreats closer towards the house. Bradley doesn’t go inside, but he does hop back onto his laptop.

I grab the dagger, my dagger. A long silver blade whose grip and weight I was becoming used to.
		
“I’m going to just teach some simple moves, us fighting with these will probably lead to some missing limbs,” she smirks at that as if that idea was more appealing.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	Sydero bypasses me and teaches Chris how to hold the dagger correctly. After this, she shows us the basic movements and how to both use it to guard and attack.

I turn my attention back to Sydero, an idea popping into my head.
		
“Hey Syd, how about a spar?” She regards me for a second before snorting in amusement.
		
“You learn a few cute tricks and think you’re ready to spar against me?”
		
“Cockiness is not a good look,” I remind but she shakes her head.
		
&lt;&lt;if $sydero &lt; 50&gt;&gt;\
	“Neither is your face, yet you don&#39;t see me pointing it out that often.”
			
	&quot;You actually do, because you&#39;re just a rude and unhappy little girl,&quot; I say back. She snorts and nods her head, a gleam resting in her eyes.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“Not cockiness, I just know you’re not ready.”
			
	“How about we see then?” She rolls her eyes but shrugs, a gleam resting in her eyes.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“Go get prepared then.” I go to do exactly that, wiping away the sweat that rests on my forehead as I prepare myself. I take a considerate amount of water, not wishing for it to slow me down. I stretch and do a quick evaluation of my body, I wasn’t sore – yet.
		
“What goes?” she questions from her side, rolling her neck from one side to the other.
		
“Anything,” I answer, it was a dirty spar, I don’t see why rules had to be given. She nods and Bradley, reluctantly again, is the one to start us. Before doing so, he gives me a worried look, though it doesn’t seem like he was concerned about me. He was hoping I’d call this off, but I wasn’t sure why since I can only tell this from his expression.
		
“Fight,” he mumbles lowly, but it’s enough to send both Sydero and I surging towards one another.

	I think about her tips from earlier and approach. I first throw a fake punch, knowing she would easily deflect it. Then throw another set, one aimed high and the other low. She dodges the first one but the second one lands. She takes the punch and turns to the side, her leg coming up and smacking me straight across the head. It does less damage only because I duck to avoid most of the impact.
					
	I immediately shoot backward, avoiding her knee.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $style is &quot;Kempo&quot;&gt;&gt;\
	I think about her tips from earlier and approach, I focus on my movement and strike out three times, each aiming for different locations. Each strike hits and causes her to pause before approaching again. I block one of her punches and strike again. This time, she’s ready. She grabs my wrist and twists it, pushing her back towards me and flipping me over her shoulder.
					
	She releases me and I back away immediately.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $style is &quot;Taekwondo&quot;&gt;&gt;\
	I think about her tips from earlier and approach. I wait till she gets close enough before sending out a short kick, one that I didn’t want to give away my reach. She shoots to the side to avoid it, and I quickly use my other leg to get her off guard. It does its job, and she just barely escapes it by ducking in time. I spin and kick out at her leg, reminding myself to stay balanced.

	Somehow, she expects this, hitting the ground and avoiding my kick, before shooting up and setting my balance off. I fall to my butt, quickly moving to get back up.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

I throw punch after punch, strike after strike, and she avoids each with quick, deft steps. I finally get the upper hand, landing a powerful strike to the side of her face and then an uppercut that causes her to stumble backward. I continue on, keeping her on her toes and striking with such speed that she doesn’t have time to think about what to do. Sydero’s movements are slowing, a trait that she tries her best to hide by behaving as if she’s just putting more thought behind her dodges.

	I wait for Sydero to approach and to throw a hit first. She throws out fake punches, and I block each one with ease. She throws another one, and I deflect her arm and palm strike at her chin, stepping forward with the action. She moves out of the way, smirking as she circles me like a starving predator.

	She suddenly rushes me with a punch, and I deflect her arm, ready to drill my elbow towards her throat. Before I can do this though, she hooks her left foot under my left leg and yanks, sending us both to the ground. Immediately she rolls on top of me, delivering three quick strikes to my stomach. I push her off and rush to my feet. 
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $style is &quot;Judo&quot;&gt;&gt;\
	I wait for Sydero to approach and she throws her first punch. I immediately grab it and toss her over my shoulder, sending us both to the ground where I hook both legs around her to keep her there.

I sit on the bench beside him and relax, allowing myself to calm down after all the training that has taken place.
		
“Bradley,” I begin, and he looks over at me, though he doesn’t seem happy with my presence.
	
“Why don’t you want to learn how to defend yourself? Even if you can’t win the fight, you can at least give them something to think about.”
		
“True. And it’s not that I’m against violence, I just don’t see the point. If something comes after me, if they really want me then I don’t think a gun, or some cute defensive moves are going to ward them off.”
		
“Again, it’ll give them something to think about.”
		
“Yes, cause my life is like a brain teaser, if they want me dead then I’m going to die.”
		
“You seem oddly at peace with that.”
		
“I’m not ready to die, no. But I accept it, I see the pros and cons of death. And sometimes,” he says and places his attention back on his screen, “the pros outweigh the cons.”

It’s a subtle shift, the edges of her eyes darkening and the amber seeming to give way to what I suppose is a crimson tone. I can feel her heartbeat pick up, beating even mine. Her face inches closer, and her eyes flicker down to the knife at my throat, before meeting my eyes. Her mouth curves upward, and she gives me an inquisitive look.

	She grows closer, cocking her head to the side to whisper in my ear, “does this turn you on?” The question itself and the tone of her voice causes short bolts of electricity to shoot down my spine. Her eyes meeting mine, waiting for an answer though we both know she already knows. I begin to croak out an answer when Bradley shouts for Syd to stop playing around and to move off of me.

	She complies. I stay where I am though, my heart beat refusing to calm as coldness replaces the air her body once occupied. It was hot, probably around the eighties but I suddenly felt very cold. I trace my finger along my neck, where the blade was, surprisingly there’s no mark, no blood.

	Bradley appears in my view, and a piece of me wishes to cuss him out for interrupting the moment. I keep my mouth closed, and he helps me to my feet.

	“Did you see her eyes change colors?” he questions.

I touch my throat to double check it, but I feel nothing there.

It was ... interesting.” I neither agree nor disagree to her statement, watching her as she walks back towards the house. Bradley appears in my view, helping me to my feet.

	“Did you see her eyes change colors?” he questions.

	“What?”
			
	“Okay, good,” he nods and pats my shoulder, leaving my side. Changing colors?
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

Chris and Bradley had started it by talking about video games, namely shooting ones. They both rant and rave about their likes and dislikes, and soon, I join in too, all of us laughing as we relive some of the funniest things we’ve seen while playing.

		Dinner arises, and we all sit in the kitchen, eating from the food that was there. The conversation is lighthearted but if viewed by a complete stranger, would think we were only associates, perhaps team members who were forced to be in the same room. Bradley talks about video games, namely shooting ones. At some intervals, Chris or I add in something about our likes and dislikes, but it stays relatively calm.

&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

The only one who doesn’t join in, of course, is Sydero. She sits beside me, but only her body is present, her mind clearly somewhere else. She’s been like this since we’ve got here. Keeping more to herself, hardly insulting me, or ranting about our predicament.

Sydero is the first to get up and disappear, though she walks outside and not toward her room. I look to Bradley for help but he doesn’t say anything, he only watches her go with a small bit of worry on his face. 

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“Anyone interested in going into town to pick up some things?” I question, “mostly stuff to clean this place up and to eat.”
	
	“I am,” Chris says, finishing the lightest dinner he’s probably ever had, “but are you sure you should go out there?”
	
	“Yea, if you want, Chris and I could just go?” Bradley suggests. I raise a brow at his words, they might have a point.

		“Come on, $name, the kid’s out here.”
						
		“This kid has a name, and yes, he’s out here, so please keep your shit PG!” Bradley shouts at us, I’m surprised he even heard the conversation. I look from Bradley back to Chris who makes it a point not to meet my gaze.

		“But is that a no?”
						
		“$name!” Both he and Bradley shout and I laugh, raising my hands in surrender. I continue to stretch beside him, only messing with him through actions as to not draw Bradley’s indignation.

		$name gets up and Chris suddenly feels a slight emptiness in his stomach. He fought with all of his might not to reach out and grab her, pulling her back to the spot that she had previously occupied. Her words rewind in his head, the flirtatious smile that decorated her features, the way those heavenly $eyes eyes sparkled, paired with words not actually spoken. He hangs his head, two seconds from thumping it against the ground.
		
		&quot;You got it bad, my friend,&quot; Sydero chuckles, approaching him and stretching as she watched $name walk away.
		
		&lt;&lt;if $chris &gt;= 50&gt;&gt;\
			&quot;I&#39;m just confused, I don&#39;t know if she likes me or if she&#39;s just flirting to play around with me,&quot; Chris admits, causing Sydero to chuckle and shake her head in disappointment. 
			
			&quot;Chris, we&#39;re talking about Roe here. She definitely likes you, it&#39;s you who&#39;s being stupid and making yourself suffer.&quot;
			
			&quot;You don&#39;t know that for sure.&quot;
			
			Sydero shrugs, &quot;I observe people. But remain scared if you want to.&quot;
		
			&lt;&lt;if $SRomance &gt;= 3&gt;&gt;\
				&quot;Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but don&#39;t you also like Roe?&quot; he questions Sydero. It was hard to forget all of those flirtatious glances that Roe sent her way, all those times Sydero stood a little to close for his liking.
			
				Sydero snorts and raised a curious brow, &quot;jealous are we?&quot;
			
				&quot;Inquiring is more like it.&quot;
				
				&quot;I&#39;m not interested in Roe like that, I think Roe knows that at least. So, go for it,&quot; Sydero said and then began to walk off, freezing and saying over her shoulder, &quot;before I change my mind.&quot; With that, Sydero left to go inside, Bradley soon following after her, and Chris next.
			&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
		&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
			&quot;First off, I&#39;m not your friend,&quot; he reminds, rolling his eyes when Sydero chuckles instead of finding offense in the statement.
			
			&quot;Point there. But don&#39;t try to change the subject off of you and your &#39;she likes me, she likes me not&#39; phase.&quot;

			&quot;It&#39;s not a phase if I don&#39;t really know if she likes me or not.&quot;

			&quot;What does she have to do, slap you across the face and scream it at you? She probably is thinking the exact same thing about you, the only difference is that she&#39;s actually trying. Ugh, some of you guys make it seem like stupidity is a disease.&quot; 

			&lt;&lt;if $SRomance &gt;= 3&gt;&gt;\
				&quot;Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but don&#39;t you also like Roe?&quot; he questions Sydero. It was hard to forget all of those flirtatious glances that Roe sent her way, all those times Sydero stood a little too close for his liking.

				Sydero snorts and raised a curious brow, &quot;jealous, are we?&quot;

				&quot;Of you, hardly. More like inquiring, for her sake.&quot;

				Sydero rolls her eyes before answering, &quot;I&#39;m not interested in Roe like that, I think Roe knows that at least.&quot; Chris began to stand when Sydero suddenly stops him, resting a hand on his chest. &quot;But watch that attitude before I do decide to just snatch up that beautiful little crush of yours. I doubt you&#39;re much of Roe&#39;s type anyway.&quot; She adds pressure, causing Chris to stagger back, and with one last look, left to go inside. Bradley soon followed after her, and Chris next.

		“Is that what you said to Morgan?” Chris asks, raising a brow. It was a question that he didn’t want the answer to. As soon as he asks it, he grumbles something and goes back to stretching.
						
		“You’re still mad at me about that. Great. So, are we going to talk about it or are you just going to continue being jealous?”
						
		“I’m not jealous,” he corrects, seeming almost offended by the truth.
						
		“You’re not jealous, but you’ve been giving me the cold shoulder since you saw Morgan leave the hotel? I don’t really see why you’re jealous though. I said I’m sorry I left you at the restaurant.”
						
		“You think this is about you leaving me at the restaurant?” he questions in disbelief.

		“That’s the only thing that makes sense; otherwise you have no reason to be mad about who I spend time with.” He begins to say something but then stops, swallowing his words instead. He nods, standing and walking off. I had a feeling I knew what he was mad at, but Chris has never said anything on it. Therefore, I don’t see how he was angry at me about not being able to read his mind.
						
		I continue to stretch, attempting to forget about him and failing.
	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	&lt;&lt;if $jealouschris is false&gt;&gt;\
		“Um, I don’t know how to respond to that? Are you just saying you like flexible men in general or ...” he questions, blushing once he says the ‘or’ part.
						
		“Just in general, a flexible man is an attractive man,” I answer; hopefully, I’m not coming on too strong. Or perhaps I shouldn’t even be coming on. Chris is straight, and I should respect that.
						
		“Can we just stretch?” he asks, giving me a blank and uncomfortable look. I immediately feel stupid and nod, trying to fight the embarrassment that screams to be shown. It gets so bad that I have to excuse myself, rushing towards the kitchen.
		&lt;&lt;link [img[images/divider.png]] &gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/link&gt;&gt;
		
		$name shoots up, excusing $himself and going into the house. Chris could do little but watch as $he went, suddenly feeling a nagging emptiness in his stomach. The remark replayed itself in his head, and his head continued to tell him that the phrase was wrong. Chris wasn&#39;t in the wrong, it was $name. Everything $name said was wrong, from the way he had smiled ... to the way those heavenly $eyes eyes of his sparkled, paired with ... No! This was precisely what he wasn&#39;t supposed to be thinking. His dad made sure to remind him that liking anything but a woman was sinful, horrible, disgusting. Yet every time $name was close, Chris never thought those things. Moments with $name were blissful, serene, ... right.
		
		He hangs his head, two seconds from thumping it against the ground.
		
		&quot;And if you look to your right, kids, we call this &#39;questioning one&#39;s sexual orientation,&#39;&quot; Sydero snickers, cocking her head to the side.
		
		&quot;Not funny, and I&#39;m not questioning.&quot;
		
		&quot;And there it goes,&quot; she says and snaps her fingers, &quot;the immediate denial. Chris, take it from someone who actually kinda is hoping the two of you get together. Stop listening to all those voices saying it&#39;s wrong, it&#39;s 2018, update yourself.&quot;
		&lt;&lt;if $SRomance &gt;= 3&gt;&gt;\
			
			&quot;Wait, but don&#39;t you have a thing for $name as well?&quot; Chris questions, a fact that he always resorted back to to move the pressure off of him. If $name liked Sydero, then it was possible that Chris was only imagining everything.
			
			Sydero snorts, &quot;I like Roe as much as I like anyone else with a silver tongue, an attractive body, and hypnotizing eyes. Which is to say, that they&#39;re eye candy and a fun teaser, but that&#39;s it.&quot;
		&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
		
		With her words spoken, she walks towards the house, Bradley following after her, and Chris soon joining them.
		
		&lt;&lt;link [img[images/divider.png]] &gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/link&gt;&gt;
	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\

		“That’s the only thing that makes sense; otherwise you have no reason to be mad about who I spend time with.” He begins to say something but then stops, swallowing his words instead. He nods, standing and walking off. There was only one other thing that he could be mad about, and though it shouldn’t, it gives me hope. It means that Chris has feelings for me, but that seems too hopeful.

		I continue to stretch, attempting to forget about him and failing.

“Same. Didn’t think she would make a great teacher. Think you can do it?”
				
“What? The whole fighting part? Eh, maybe. I’ve never been a fan of fighting, but these supernatural creatures don’t exactly care about us being pacifist now do they.” I chuckle and nod, switching my position to continue stretching.

“Trying, I suppose. It just seems like something big always comes in and changes my mind, causes me to go back to the beginning of asking what the actual fuck. And I don’t know, it’s strange to think that maybe one day I’ll actually forget what this feels like. I’ll forget what it feels like to be freaked out by all of this and to be disbelieving. One day I’m going to walk out of some dusty warehouse, after just killing a werewolf and be like, that’s the fifteenth werewolf this week. What’s their problem?” 
				
We both chuckle, we shared that thought. The thought that one day this would all be natural and would one day be routine.

I lean forward, looking around waiting for whatever it was to jump out at me. Nothing does. I get out of bed, opening the door and looking down the short hallway.

	“I’m offended,” I hear a voice say and I freeze. A chill runs over my bones and the pain in my arms intensifies, but for the moment, I’m numb to it. I turn slowly, each small movement begging on hands and knees that it was all in my head, that voice wasn’t really here.

“$name, you think I’m just part of some unfortunate dream?” the familiar figure asks, leaning against the far wall. If my memory serves correct, then this figure ... the Entity hasn’t changed one bit. Their entire being was still a basic black figure. Every couple of seconds their body glitches slightly, reminding me less of a black mass and more of a black sketch. Thin black wisps of smoke roll off their body, curling around them before evaporating. With every shift, the smoke is interrupted, but it shortly rights itself once again.

“I spend all that time, all that work to traumatize you, and you write me off as a dream,” they continue on, resting a hand over what I can only assume is meant to be their heart.

	They stop to lean forward, eye level wtih me now, “but this won&#39;t end the same way it did last time. That, I guarantee.” They throw me across the room, and I slide down off the wall to the floor. “Because this time, you’re mine.” My eyes widen in fear when my door opens. Bradley stands there, yawning loudly, wiping the sleep from his eye as he glares over at me.

	“What’s wrong with you? Trying to see how fast you can wake everyone up?” I look to see the Entity gone, of course they were. But not only that, I wasn’t on the floor but in my bed. Sweat dribbles down the side of my face, and I clutch the blanket tightly to my body. The pain in my chest, gone.

“I ... I,” I try, but words don’t formulate into actual sentences. I sigh and apologize underneath my breath instead. He rolls his eyes and leaves, perhaps too sleepy to question me further. I take another look around the room, the feeling that was once there is now no longer. Normally, this would be a great sign, a sign that the Entity was gone, and all was right. But this new feeling had the opposite effect on me.

Was I dreaming? Was the Entity truly real or was my brain back to giving me traumatic dreams? Or did it actually happen? Was I awake?

An invisible force pounds against my head as I lay back down. The rest of the night is peaceful, the most chaotic thing being my thoughts.

	“Ah, this trick,” they sigh, grabbing me by both hands before my fist can collide into them, “you&#39;ve already seen how this ends, right? Or is that just something else you lied to yourself about?” Both arms burn wildly, and I let out a loud whimper as they hold me in place.
	
	They lean forward, eye level wtih me now, “but this won&#39;t end the same way it did last time. That, I guarantee.” They throw me across the room, and I slide down off the wall to the floor. “Because this time, you’re mine.” My eyes widen in fear when my door opens. Bradley stands there, yawning loudly, wiping the sleep from his eye as he glares over at me.
	
	“What the hell are you doing? Wrestling yourself?” I look to see the Entity gone, of course they were. But not only that, I wasn’t on the floor but in my bed. Sweat dribbles down the side of my face, and I clutch the blanket tightly to my body. The pain in my arms, gone.

I take another look around the room, the feeling that was once there is now no longer. Normally, this would be a great sign, a sign that the Entity was gone, and all was right. But this new feeling had the opposite effect on me.

Was I dreaming? Was the Entity truly real or was my brain back to giving me traumatic dreams. Or did it actually happen? Was I awake?

An invisible force pounds against my head as I lay back down. The rest of the night is peaceful, the most chaotic thing being my thoughts.

After jotting down these things, I stare at the list. It was much longer than I originally planned, but once I started, I found it impossible to stop. Despite its length, it was actually a great list. Only food items that wouldn’t go bad fast or would immediately be consumed reside there. Other than food and drink, I had included some cleaning items to whip this place up.

	Bradley comes in next, clapping loudly as soon as he enters. I don’t question his actions. Instead, I focus back on the list that I was sure was complete.
	
	“Had fun last night, $name?” Bradley asks, his tone making me think he was actually curious.
	
	“Not really.”
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“What happened last night?” Bradley questions as he enters, “sounded like you were up all night having a me party.” I wouldn’t have put it in such a way, but I suppose it was better than saying I had a malevolent imaginary friend after me.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

Sydero is the last to show up, her appearance disheveled.

“Long night too?” Bradley asks.

She nods, rubbing her temples, “what do you mean by &#39;too&#39;?”

“$name was, well do you want to explain yourself?” Bradley asks, the table looking at me now.

I didn’t want to, nor know how to tell them what had really taken place. I wasn’t even sure of what had taken place.

“So, here’s the list,” I finally say, pushing the list to the middle of the table for all to see. Bradley leans in curiously while Sydero makes it a point to move away from it, wishing to show how much she didn’t care.

Like I had surmised earlier, getting there early was wise, only ten other cars sit in the large parking lot. Inside, I could only see a handful of people walking around, most of them being employees. It’s a humble store, large enough to satisfy many needs but it was also small and quaint. The type of store one can walk into and remember the majority of everyone’s name and learn the layout after two visits.

I watch in interest as she raises her hand slowly and the can obeys, rising higher and higher. Suddenly she shoots her hand down, and though the can drops, she doesn’t look happy about it.
	
[[Approach Syd.]]
[[Go back in the house.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="821" name="Approach Syd." tags="" position="2876,3307" size="100,100">I approach Syd, curious about what she was up to, and because I was just bored.
			
“Whatcha doing?” I question once I get close enough, she looks at me but says nothing, turning back around.
	
“Practicing,” she finally replies, squeezing her hand into a fist and causing the can to explode, “poorly anyway.”
			
“Your powers.”
			
“Is that what it looks like, then that’s what it is. Instead of questioning me, why don’t you go practice? You’ve never shot a moving can before,” she tells me, nodding over at the cans that are just sitting there.

I grumble as I walk away, but I do as she suggests, it wasn’t like she didn’t have a point. I don’t necessarily practice hitting a moving target, but I do improve my shooting ability. The more I shoot, the better I get. My accuracy improves, and so does my timing. I practice from closer and greater distances, finally stopping since some of the cans would probably explode if I shot them again.

I’ve worked up quite the sweat, and if I stay outside any longer, the sun will cook me. So, I decide to take a break, get some water and go somewhere where the sun’s assault wouldn’t be able to reach me.

I grumble as I walk away, stopping when I get an idea.
			
“What are you practicing?” I ask her again, “we may be able to help each other.”

“I’m trying to condition myself to throw these cans using only my mind, using my hands is too much of a giveaway, plus a hindrance at times.”

“Okay, so how about this. You practice your part by throwing the cans in the air, moving them and all that and I try to shoot them. That way you can practice, and I can hit moving targets.” Sydero gives me an impressed smile, nodding to say that she was in.

For the next thirty minutes or so, we practice. Sydero’s failure to use her mind doesn’t impede on my training, and my training only helps her since it presented a distraction noise. If she couldn’t zone me out, then her training would be for naught. Both of us improve the longer we go. My last two shots hit the target square on, and Sydero is able to move them using only her mind.

All in all, a successful day.

&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
I go back into the house and look around, grabbing the //Book of the Damned//. I hadn&#39;t really picked this book up much, due to me still trying to learn about the individual supernatural creatures, but I was curious to see what this book had to offer. 

I turn to a legend regarding a cryptid named the Wendigo. It was mainly part of the Algonquian and Native American lore and its name literally translated to &quot;evil spirit who eats humans.&quot; Which, to be fair, could be labeled upon the majority of supernatural creatures that I&#39;ve come across. But, I continue to read, finding the lore around this particular beast interesting.

There were a handful of legends about what the Wendigo was, and how it came to be. But all of them said that the Wendigo was once a human. When the individual reverted to cannibalism, they turned into a cannibalistic beast.

The book talks about one such legend that spoke about what many believe was the first Wendigo. One cold winter a tribe, to survive, was forced to eat their dead. Though many of them did not shift, one individual&#39;s thirst for his own, grew until he ate one still living. His greed and taste for blood were not sated, and he continued until he had decimated his entire tribe.

That winter, he lived, and he shifted. He shifted into a horrendous, slender beast whose ribs were visible. His nails had grown into long talons, and his eyes glowed in the dark. He was fast, senses enhanced, and he mimicked human voices, hoping to lure more humans in so he could continue his eternal feast.

The book continues to explain more about them: where they&#39;re from, how to protect oneself, what they look like, and how to know if one is being hunted. Once I&#39;m done, I leave the table hoping to never come across one.

“The real question is what are you doing here? You’re trespassing.” The girl sniffles as she gazes up at Sydero, and before any of us can say anything more, she bursts into tears.

&lt;&lt;if $sympathy &lt; 50&gt;&gt;\

	“What do we do?” I whisper to her.

		“What makes you think I know? Do you remember how I reacted to you when your uncle died?” She had a point.
	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
		“What makes you think I know?” I guess it was a stretch, hoping that she could answer my question.
	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

	I glance back at the hysterical girl, her body shaking as she tries to stop crying and to speak to us. The only thing I can think of is to guide her to the kitchen and sit her in the seat. I steal the seat beside her and sit, wondering what I should do next. I just don’t know how to react when people behave like this, I could barely handle myself when I was hysterical. Sydero passes the girl a bottle of water and takes a seat in the other free chair.

	I immediately go to the girl’s side, resting a friendly hand on her back. I bring her close to me and walk her towards the kitchen, placing her in an open seat as I grab her a bottle of water.
		
	“Sydero, go get me some tissue.” Much to my amazement, she doesn’t question or even give me a disapproving look, she just goes to do as I say. She comes back a few seconds later with an extremely large wad of tissue paper. It was excessive, but I guess this was better than nothing.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

It takes a while, but the girl finally calms down enough to speak.

“I’m running away,” she tells us, clearing her throat, “I was going to run here until I made up my mind more, but I see that I can’t.”

“Why are you running?” I ask her, and she shakes her head, gulping down some of the water. She begins to peel at some of the paint on the table. I wait for her to answer but she doesn’t. I know how stressful high school is, especially with everything that I went through during my time there. I knew the stress and the want to just quit.

“She’s not running away,” Sydero finally says, leaning towards the girl, “are you?” The girl gulps but doesn’t say anything. Sydero’s attention moves to me. “She has nothing with her. If she were running, then she would have a pack, a phone, a wallet, something to help her out. She didn’t come here to figure out what to do, she came here to end it.” My eyes widen as I look from her to the guilty sitting girl.

“That’s right,” she whispers, “I can’t take it anymore.”

“Use your words woman,” I growl, trying to shake her free. She stops, drawing the curtains back enough for me to peek outside.
	
“We have a visitor.” I look to see a girl walking towards us, her arms wrapped around herself.

“Crap, what do we do?”

“Do you really want me to answer that?” Sydero questions, a glimmer in her eyes. She was right, I didn’t. Knowing her, she could think of no other idea but to kill her, which would bring more people here in search for her.

“I know one thing,” Sydero says, glancing out the window at them, “we don’t have a lot of time to come up with something.” I glance outside the window to see the woman was practically at the door. We exchange looks and rush to the door right as its thrown open.

We stare at the girl, and she at us. Now that she was closer, I can see that her cheeks are wet, and her eyes glazed over and red.

“Who are you?” she questions, “this building is supposed to be abandoned.”
	
[[“Home designers.”]]

“You guys don’t look like contractors,” the girl points out.
			
“And you don’t look like a high school dropout but you’re here and not at school, we don’t judge,” Sydero answers, “and you’re also trespassing.” The girl sniffles as she gazes up at Sydero, and before any of us can say anything more, she bursts into tears.

&lt;&lt;if $sympathy &lt; 50&gt;&gt;\

	“What do we do?” I whisper to her.

	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
		“What makes you think I know?” I guess it was a stretch, hoping that she could answer my question.
	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

	I glance back at the hysterical girl, her body shaking as she tries to stop crying and to speak to us. The only thing I can think of is to guide her to the kitchen and sit her in the seat. I steal the seat beside her and sit, wondering what I should do next. I just don’t know how to react when people behave like this, I could barely handle myself when I was hysterical.

	I was out of my field here, I didn’t know how to behave around people with suicidal tendencies. Though I guess I could use my own experience. 
	
	I remember how dark it was, how dreary and gray the world had become. It was more of my uncle than me who helped me out of that world, he colored the world for me and taught me how to see the vibrant colors once again.

But after seeing the cuts, and the placement of the bruises, they could very well be self-inflicted.

Sydero scratches her chin and grabs something out of her back pocket. I stare with widened eyes as she slides a gun towards the young girl. The house is quiet, even the world outside the building. We all stare at the gun, Sydero staring at the girl.

“You know,” I begin, biting my cheek as I wonder if I want to speak about that dark time, “I’ve had the same thoughts.” Her eyes widen, and I wonder if this is the first time she has spoken to someone who has been in a similar spot to hers. “Yea, I was in a place that I don’t like thinking back on. I felt like there was no point to life and that living was just a waste of time. I seriously failed to see the point, nothing but bad things were happening. I had dreams plague me every night, and I was traumatized.”
			
“What made you not go through with it?” I think hard, and a small smile comes onto my face.

“I had a good support system, my uncle knew and understood what I was feeling, and so he was always there. But that was just a piece of it, I had to want to live and look forward to the future.” She hums, and I gaze over at Sydero who gives me what can almost be the beginning of a smile, a genuine one at that.

Sydero scratches her chin and grabs something out of her back pocket. I stare with widened eyes as she slides a gun towards the young girl. The house is quiet, even the world outside the building. We all stare at the gun, Sydero staring at the girl.

“At the end of the day, it’s your choice. None of us can influence you. Your loved ones can give you all the support you need, you can see the top therapists and doctors in the world, and that still might not be enough. If you don’t think your life is worth it, then that’s all that matters in the end. No one can make you want to live. So, grab the gun or don’t grab the gun. It’s your choice.” The girl glances from me to Sydero, her eyes resting on the gun.

I snort and lean back in my seat, “well, life isn’t really worth it anyway. Think about it. We didn’t ask for this, and yet here we are, having to go through it. There’s so much pain in this world. The future, for all we know, just gets darker and more depressing.”
			
My words weren’t meant to make her feel better, they were more of a personal rant. The young teen nods in understanding. I look over at Sydero who’s still staring at the girl, she hasn’t said anything yet, though I suppose I didn’t expect her too.

Sydero scratches her chin and grabs something out of her back pocket. I stare with widened eyes as she slides a gun towards the young girl. The house is quiet, even the world outside the building. We all stare at the gun, Sydero staring at the girl.

“Well, if you choose death, just don’t make too much of a mess then.” The girl’s eyes widen in shock and horror, probably believing that I was going to try and talk her out of it. I wasn’t her therapist or parent, I hardly knew the girl, so my words meant nothing. I look over at Sydero, right as she looks away from me. I could’ve sworn I saw disappointment in her eyes though.

Sydero scratches her chin and grabs something out of her back pocket. I stare with widened eyes as she slides a gun towards the young girl. The house is quiet, even the world outside the building. We all stare at the gun, Sydero staring at the girl.

I refuse to say anything, to dissuade or aid her current actions. I don’t like holding that kind of power or knowing that my words influenced someone to finally end their life. Or that only because I said something, a stranger, someone decided to continue living. I just didn’t want to say anything at all, it was her life, not mine.

“Wait, are you serious, Sydero? She’s a teenager,” I growl and move my attention from Syd to the girl. “As humans, we hardly can see past the day we live in. Do you know what your future can hold? How rich it can be? Talk to your parents and friends, tell them how you feel. See a therapist and get your fears out there.”
			
“Completely irrelevant,” Sydero snorts, “you’re basing your words off of speculation. Guessing that maybe her future will be better if she fights. And if it’s not? If every day is just failure after failure, pushing her further into depression?”
			
“And if it is brighter? If tomorrow begins a new path for her. Making her look back on this day and see how happy she is that she fought for it?”
			
“Again, speculation. It doesn’t matter what the future holds. The world could end tomorrow, she could die tomorrow, she could meet the love of her life tomorrow, she could find everything she’s ever wanted. The keyword is could. She could have a great life and still hate herself, still despise who she is. That’s no way to live.” Sydero rises and looks down at the girl. “It’s your choice, don’t let others take that away from you.” She sends me a glare before leaving the room, the gun still resting in front of the girl.
		
I hold my breath as I watch her. Tears stream down her eyes as her hand inches towards the gun. She picks it up, letting her free hand trail along it. I can practically imagine what she’s feeling, the cold hard metal of the gun. I gulp.
			
She places the gun down and nods her head, sliding her chair back.
			
“I need to think about what you guys said, but I’m glad that my ... path, led me here. I need to think about what I want, and ... just thank you. Can you thank your co-worker too?” I nod, taking my eyes off of the gun and placing them onto the young woman. I see her out, watching as she takes her time to leave the way she came. I shiver as I watch her go, despite the warm air and the almost non-existent summer heat. I don’t know what she’s thinking and what she’ll decide, but I hope she chooses life, and that she finds things worth living for.

“Syd does have a point,” I say, biting the inside of my lip, “if you’re not happy, then no amount of outside help will ever make you better. You have to want it for yourself, others can’t want it for you and that be all. All we can say is that it’s your choice and only yours.” I feel Syd’s eyes on me, before moving to the girl.
			
We don’t rush her, we don’t pressure her, we just sit in silence and watch her. Tears stream down her eyes as her hand inches towards the gun. She picks it up, letting her free hand trail along it. I can practically imagine what she’s feeling, the cold hard metal of the gun. The danger, yet the freedom. I gulp.
			
She places the gun down and nods her head, sliding her chair back.
			
“I need to think about what you guys said, but I’m glad that my ... path, led me here. I need to think about what I want, and ... just thank you.” Sydero nods and reaches over to grab the gun, pocketing it again. We see her out, watching as she takes her time to leave the way she came.
			
“You were just going to let her shoot her brains out at the kitchen table?” I question with a grimace and a raised brow.
			
“The gun wasn’t loaded,” she tells me, her eyes on the distant figure of the girl, “the point was to give her a choice. If she pulled the trigger, then she would’ve made her choice.”
			
“What if she was too scared to try a second time?”
			
“Then her choice would&#39;ve changed. If she really wanted out, she would find a way, regardless of an unloaded gun.”
		
“So, does this sort of thing happen a lot with you? You save or push people closer to that cliff?”
			
“Don’t word it like that,” Sydero growls, her attention still on the path the girl had taken, “but kinda. You meet a lot of people in this job, some because they become clients or you’re helping them. Others because they just stumble onto your path. You never know what will happen, really. Tell me, $name,” she turns to me, a rare serious expression on her face, “do you believe in fate?”

	Sydero turns to me in curiosity, “you didn’t say anything?” I shrug and go back inside with her following.
				
	“It wasn’t my place. I have no right telling someone what to do with their life.”

I lay in my bed, sinking into the mattress when I feel a nearby presence. I fight the whimper, but it comes out regardless, I turn to see the Entity on the edge of the bed, staring at me with that large cartoonish grin.

For some reason, no matter how many times they appear, I fail to use my words. They form but the act of getting them out of that premature stage never happens, they die in my throat, and I’m left with a foul taste residing in my mouth.

&lt;&lt;if $uncaring&gt;&gt;\

	“Look at you, $name, saving little girls and playing the hero. You must feel all warm inside, huh? You finally did something right in your miserable little life.”

	“Shut up,” I shout, sneering, “you resort to empty insults because you have nothing else to say. I helped that girl, and you’re trying to think of ways to twist that.”
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“That girl is going to kill herself, and it’s going to be your fault.” Regardless if I care or not, a chill crawls down my spine. If my heart could freeze over, then it was doing it right now.

“You’re not real,” I tell myself, taking multiple breaths with my eyes closed. When I open them, they&#39;re gone. Did that really work? Did I really make them go away? I don’t calm down for several minutes, thinking that as soon as I do, they’ll return. But when I drift off, and they don’t plague them, my doubts grow.

“Again,” Sydero commands, rotating her wrist around lazily, “and for the last time, fix your stance.” She taps the thick stick to the insides of both of my legs, forcing me to spread them farther apart like they were meant to be. After correcting my stance, I raise the stick in my hands once again, ready to redo the set of moves that Sydero had shown me.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	Chris lunges forward like she had taught him. In response, I take a step back and counter his attack. My mind is on two different things at once, trying to actually complete the simple move as well as trying not to get hit by Chris’s stick. There was also me trying to keep my stance perfect, and I was busy trying to find an opening. 
	
	One finally shows itself when Chris reaches out too far.
	
	[[Do a complicated move.]]
	[[Simply tap him.]]

&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	I take the step forward, mainly working on my stance and making sure I could keep my balance despite whatever was coming at me. I nod at Sydero, and she raises her hands, pushing me back lightly with her powers. I focus all of my attention on my stance and feet, the feeling of becoming unbalanced slowly taking over. 

	She increases the pressure just as I get resituated. This time I feel my feet leave the ground as I’m sent back. I wasn’t that far up, but I was far enough up to where if I land incorrectly, it would be horrible for my ankles.

	“What should you always have with you, Roe?” Sydero asks, yawning as she watches me.

We break and head off to get the items. I head to the cleaning aisle, perusing it nonchalantly with my grocery cart. For a minute, I snicker at my actions. This was almost //too// domestic, and I feel like I’m back living my normal life. Normal life, the further I go into this life the more the line blurs. One day this will be my normal life.

	“Isn’t that the feeling everyone gets when shopping?” Bradley questions. I don’t have time to answer or comment though, a man begins walking towards us.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“You look really familiar,” he begins, taking out his phone. And that was the signal for me to go. I gaze around, trying to figure out what the best course of action was.
	
[[Act like I’m famous.]]

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“Duh, this is $fname McGee, youngest Grammy winner ever? $He literally held Billboard’s number one spot for five straight months,” Bradley tells the man.
	
	“Uncultured swine,” Chris mumbles.
				
	“And you’re interrupting my picture,” Bradley scoots closer to me and raises his phone, trying to figure out what pose to do. Chris comes over, and we pose for the picture, hoping to sell it to the guy. He fumbles with his words, when his eyes flicker to his screen, his eyes widening.
				
	That was definitely my cue to run.

The tag game ensues as I try to figure out what to do. They had probably called the cops already, and the store was locked down. We need an out, and we need it now.

&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
I fail to think of any way out besides breaking the front of the store’s window or door. This life was making me desperate, just something else I suppose I can scratch off the bucket list.

I head down the garden aisle and grab a shovel, here goes nothing. I sprint to the front of the store, ignoring the screaming and shouting people there. I zone them out and focus on destroying the glass door. Three well-placed hits and the door comes down.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“Freedom!” I scream, throwing the shovel towards the man who was still chasing after me. I take off towards the car, getting in and driving off immediately. I know I was leaving Chris and Bradley behind, and once I was safe, I’d call them. But at the moment I needed it to seem as if I had disappeared.

I spend the majority of time gazing up at the sky from the top of my car. I had just vandalized that store in front of people, people who thought I was some crazed felon. Despite my situation and all of the things I’ve seen, I snicker.

“Ever think you would end up doing all this, Past Me?” I question aloud, to myself but not to myself. I wonder what Past Me would think about what we’ve become.

Laying on the roof of my car, waiting for the heat on me to go down because I was lucky enough to be recognized at some insignificant store. Yep, definitely the life I pictured for myself. In the distance, I can hear the sound of sirens going off, though I’m not worried. My current hiding place was buried deep in the woods, and I hadn’t taken any trails to get here. Getting back was probably going to be the worst part about this entire journey.

I’m pulled out of my thoughts by the vibration in my pocket, taking it out to see that the coast was clear. I stare up at the sky one last time before getting off my car and going inside.
		
&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	I pick up my two stragglers much further down the road. Chris somehow was able to keep the shopping cart with all of the items on the list, and fit Bradley in there as well. He sits on top of a few groceries, eating a bag of gummy bears.
			
	“Had fun playing fugitive?” Bradley asks with a sneer.
			
	“Yea, almost as much fun as you guys had it would seem.”

	“After you broke that door, all hell broke loose. We were able to grab everything and then get out without paying for it,” Chris tells me, smiling shyly.

	“Can I just say though,” Bradley begins, “watching you break that door was the highlight of my week, maybe even month, and I just want to thank you for that.” I roll my eyes, ushering them to hurry up so that we can get out of here quicker.

Attempting to be sneaky, I sneak to the back of the store and search for the door that leads to the employee break room. I come across it, shocked when I find that it’s unlocked. I suppose it was too early in the morning, and the town was small enough to where they didn’t fear others walking in and out. I’m sure my presence was the most exciting thing to happen this week.
			
&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	I run through the break room and then find the door that says supply. Through here there should be a loading dock or at least an entrance to wheel the supplies in. I find this very door after what feels like forever. I’ll have to call Bradley and Chris later to tell them where to meet me, for now, I just need to get out of here.

I burst out of the building and take off into the woods like a madman. I’ll hide out in the woods until everything has calmed down, then I’ll call for the cavalry.

I spend the majority of time gazing up at the sky from the tree that I had chosen to climb up. I had just barely managed to escape that store full of people, people who thought I was some crazed felon. Despite my situation and all of the things I’ve seen, I snicker.

	“Had fun playing fugitive?” Bradley asks with a sneer from the backseat.
			
	“Yea, almost as much fun as you guys had it would seem.”

	“We didn’t know where you went, but everyone was panicking about how they couldn’t find you. We used all that hysteria to get out.” Chris tells me, smiling shyly.

	“And guess what the best part is,” Bradley begins, “we didn’t pay for any of this shit.” I roll my eyes, getting inside so we could go.

&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
I freeze as the thought comes to mind. Taking Bradley hostage could work, and I did have my knife with me.
	
“Bradley,” I call out, trying to find the boy that I had just seen. He comes running down an aisle, and I call him to me.

“Work with me, alright?” I tell him, and he nods though it’s clear he has no idea what I’m about to do. I grab him and go to the front of the store where the majority of the employees are.

“Open the doors,” I yell at them, grabbing my knife and placing it to Bradley’s neck. His eyes widen in shock, I guess it was a good thing I didn’t tell him what I had planned to do. Everyone begins to scream at me to let him go, some of the women now crying.

“Please, don’t let $him kill me,” Bradley cries out in desperation, “Momma!” He fights my hold, giving up.
			
&lt;&lt;if $sympathy &gt;= 50&gt;&gt;\
	I had to give the kid props, he was even pulling at my heartstrings, and I knew he was just acting.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“Let the child go, and you can go,” one of the women tells me and I roll my eyes, pointing to the door with my blade.

“Tell them to open it, now!” She glances from Bradley to me, to her walkie-talkie. She wasn’t going to do it, she thought I was bluffing. I snort and hover the blade over Bradley’s collarbone, //sorry about this buddy//. I make a slice, delicately, one not too deep. Bradley screams out in response.

“Fuck! You cut me, $he cut me! Holy-freakin’ Jesus!” I now didn’t know if he was simply just acting anymore. I place the knife back up to his neck and shrug my shoulders.

“Tell me if you want his life on your hands, I kill him, and I’ll just grab another hostage.”

“Open the doors,” she tells the men and the light over the doors turn on. I immediately yank Bradley behind me, heading towards the car. I push him in and immediately start it up, driving off down the wrong way.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“Wait, what about Chris?” Bradley asks, looking back towards the store.
				
	“I’m going to contact him later, he knows I had to get out of there.”

	“Oh, okay.” Suddenly Bradley slaps me on the back of the neck, almost causing me to swerve off the road.

	“Seriously?” I yell at him, but he doesn’t seem to care.

	“Don’t you cut me again! That seriously hurt.” I apologize, driving off the road and into the woods. I’ll wait here until everything calms down.

I spend the majority of time gazing up at the sky from the top of my car. I had just kidnapped and threatened a young kid in front of people, people who thought I was already some crazed felon. My actions today kinda just proved them right. I gaze over at my young hostage, picking grass lazily as we both listen to the sirens in the distance.

“How does it feel to be kidnapped?” I question him, breaking the silence between us.

“Boring. I thought there would be more threats and tears.”

“Bradley, you do realize that I didn’t really kidnap you, right?”

“And there lies the problem, your acting was subpar, I barely bought it. The only reason you get even some points is because you cut me.” He sends me a heated glare at the last part, but I roll my eyes, tuning back into the distant sirens. They were getting farther away, in a while it would be safe for us to move. Until then, we wait.

It&#39;s a couple minutes later when Bradley gets to his feet, clapping his hands.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“Well, let’s go pick up the lost man, I’m sure the heat has gone down enough to drive around without fear.” He was right, faster we get back to the house the better anyway. I call Chris to learn where he is, and we drive towards him. Thankfully, Chris was able to grab everything from the list, plus the shopping cart.

	“This town hates you by the way,” he tells me, loading the items into the vehicle, “mothers especially.” Bradley grins wide at this, pleased to know so many care about his wellbeing I assume. He could be proud all he wanted to, but this only meant that a manhunt was probably out looking for me. This thought causes me to quicken my pace, and I usher everyone into the car so that we can go.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“Well, let’s go before the police move their search here.” He was right, faster we get back to the house the better anyway. We would be going back emptyhanded but I’d rather that than be sitting in a jail cell.

	We arrive back at the house without any further trouble. Sydero is nowhere to be seen, and I don’t know if I want to hear her mouth upon finding her.

I lay in my bed, sinking into the mattress when I feel a nearby presence. I fight the whimper, but it comes out regardless, I turn to see the Entity on the edge of the bed, staring at me with that large cartoonish grin.

For some reason, no matter how many times they appear, I fail to use my words. They form but the act of getting them out of that premature stage never happens, they die in my throat, and I’m left with a foul taste residing in my mouth.

&lt;&lt;if $hostage&gt;&gt;\
	“Look at you, $name, taking little boys hostage and cutting them up. What kind of sick twisted mind do you have? Do you get off on that?”
		
	“That little boy is a friend, and that was all a ploy to get out of a tight situation.”

	“Cute, I may have to use that same wording next time I&#39;m fulfilling my dark fantasies.”

	“Shut up!” I growl, and the Entity lets out a long deep chuckle, a chuckle that causes my blood to boil.

	“You’re not real,” I remind both them and me, taking multiple breaths, when I open them, they&#39;re gone. Did that really work? Did I really make them go away? I don’t calm down for several minutes, thinking that as soon as I do, they&#39;ll return. But when I drift off, and they don&#39;t plague my dreams, my doubts grow.
&lt;&lt;elseif $woods&gt;&gt;\
	“Look at you, $name, off playing felon and running away from what you measly insects call justice.”

	“You would know nothing of justice,” I growl, feeling disgusting even talking to the creature at the edge of my bed, “you’re not even real.” The last part was more for my own personal sanity. I glance away, closing my eyes and taking numerous breaths in. When I open them, they&#39;re gone. Did that really work? Did I really make them go away?

	“Can you go crawl under a rock or something?” I growl, feeling disgusted even talking to the creature at the edge of my bed. They chuckle.

	“I’m sure you wish you had that shovel still, perhaps you could imagine yourself finally getting that revenge of yours.” Though I know it was impossible, the thought itself did make me wonder and wish I hadn’t thrown it away.

	“I would love to, but you’re not even real.” The last part was more for my own personal sanity. I glance away, closing my eyes and taking numerous breaths in. When I open them, they&#39;re gone.

I picture me hitting him with a simple move, and then thinking up all of the things that I could do to make sure he stays down. Of course, I wasn’t trying to permanently take Chris down, but the mindset was a healthy one to develop.
			
I do two quick taps to Chris’s midsection and then kick his feet out from under him before he can react. As soon as his back hits the ground, I put a knee to his chest and the stick to his neck.
			
“Even I have to admit that that was a pretty good takedown. Not too flashy but highly sufficient,” Sydero compliments, shocking both Chris and me.

I wait for the right moment, and then move in for the strike. A simple attack was all that was needed. Seeing that Chris was just a scrimmage party, and not to mention my brother, there was no reason for me to do anything more.
			
“Simple enough,” Sydero states, “in a real fight you’re going to have to put in more effort, but I can’t complain.”
			
“Well, I’m thankful,” Chris tells me.

I picture me hitting him with a simple move, and then thinking up all of the things that I could do to make sure he stays down. I can’t help but want to add some kind of extraordinary move to it, maybe could even start developing some sort of signature move.
			
I do two quick taps to Chris’s midsection, and with my free hand, I go to grab the stick he has. As I do this, I kick his knee and grab the stick, putting both sticks to his neck as I grin down at him.
			
“Dead,” I sneer. He pushes me away from him roughly, pushing himself back up to his feet.
			
“Cute,” Sydero starts, “you started off great, and then you started being you.”
			
“I thought it looked rad,” Bradley shouts from the porch. I set down both branches as I smirk at the other two, each rolling their eyes in annoyance.

I stare at the ground that was fast approaching, my mind on two different things now.
			
“Seriously, now, Syd?” I yell, just as I land. I was going to fall on my back, so I make sure I move just enough for my feet to go first. As soon as my feet touch ground I bend my knees and drop into a rough roll.

“I wish I had one of those annoyingly loud alarms to sound whenever you’re wrong. Granted, I’d be sounding it almost every second but still,” Sydero tells me. Before I can either say anything or shoot a comeback her way, the sound she had described blares out. I jerk around to face Bradley who throws up a thumbs up.
			
“Found it for you,” he shouts.

“My knife,” I immediately yell out as I refocus on my landing. I was going to land on my back, so I make sure I move just enough for my feet to go first. As soon as my feet touch ground I bend my knees and drop into a rough roll.
			
“Nice, you’re thinking on your toes,” Sydero sneers. Bradley laughs at her ridiculous pun while I just send her what I hope is my ‘never again’ face. Her grin only grows though.

[[Continue-&gt;ER7]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="873" name="ER7" tags="" position="4581,3201" size="100,100">“So, break, right? I can actually get off my feet right now?” I give her no time to answer, immediately taking a seat on the first step my butt touches.

“You’re going to die out there,” I hear that eerie familiar voice say, their voice so close to my ear that it tickles. Instinctually, I jump, landing on the harsh ground. When I look back towards my previous seat, nothing but air resides there. I’m fully aware of the confused looks that I receive, Bradley being the one to immediately speak up.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“What, a fly was trying to whisper in your ear?” That gets Chris laughing, and the two of them snicker over Bradley’s words together.
	
	“They don’t take you seriously, huh? You’re just here for the giggles,” the Entity says to me. When I jerk around this time, the figure is sitting casually on the ground. The grass near them withers violently before dying.
	
	“Get away from me,” I tell them, looking to the others, hoping they see them too. The confusion on their face tells me that they don’t though.
	
	“Who are you talking to?” Chris asks, approaching me nervously.
	
	“You’re telling me you don’t see them?” I ask them each, pointing to the dead grass, “you don’t see that?”
	
	“The grass?” Chris questions. I reach towards the grass, stopping as I stare down at the healthy vibrant kiwi green blades that rest in my hand, the same turf that I saw wilt and die before my eyes.
	
	“You’re losing it, $name,” the Entity chuckles cruelly. Their words only add fuel to the fire, as all three of them continue to look at me with worried or curious eyes, “imagining things that aren&#39;t even there.”
	
	“Guess the sun’s starting to get to you, huh?” Sydero finally says, picking up the sticks and throwing them towards the woods. She nods to the house and the other two head towards it, passing me one last look before disappearing inside.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“What, a fly was trying to whisper in your ear?” Bradley laughs at his own joke, not caring that neither Sydero nor I find it very funny.
	
	“They don’t take you seriously, huh? You’re just here for the giggles,” the Entity says to me. When I jerk around this time, the figure is sitting casually on the ground. The grass near them withers violently before dying.

I get up and head towards the door when a black fog emerges. It shoots towards my nostrils, and I inhale every ounce of it, panicking at the lack of knowledge of what was now inside me. My vision begins to blur, and the world grows darker, everything in a dismal grayscale. I scream out for help and instead hear my voice miles away in an unknown direction.

&lt;&lt;if $nerve &gt;= 40&gt;&gt;\
	I tell myself to calm down, to take numerous breaths and not to let this congested air get to me. Panicking won’t help me. I center myself, though it’s much harder to do since every piece of me feels off balanced. It takes more time than usual, but I finally feel my heart steady, and I can think clearly.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;
	My breathing speeds up and comes in rapid bursts. I feel a shiver run down my body, feeling hot yet cold all at the same time. Suddenly, I feel off balanced, as if teetering on the edge of a cliff. My ears pick up nothing but my thumping heart, each beat rings through my ears.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“You’re not real,” I hear the Entity mimic, their voice all around me, above and below me. I hear their voice in my own mind, and outside of it. It echoes through me.

“Where the hell am I?” I shout, again my voice not coming out of my mouth, but in the distance, I can barely hear it.

“I don’t answer to you, pet,” they growl, the feeling of claws painfully sinking into my back with their words. I try to move but only feel the same drunken feeling I did before, feeling profoundly off balance and woozy.

“You just follow the rules, and we’ll have no problems. Understand?”

“Okay, fuck you, first of all. I thought I got rid of your ugliness years ago, but obviously, I didn’t. What is your obsession with me, huh? If you wanted to possess me, then you would’ve already done it, the same thing with killing me, so it’s obvious you need me alive. So, tell –” I feel a sharp sting in my stomach, enough to make me fall to my knees and want to throw up my lungs.
		
“Watch your mouth,” they hiss.
		
“I obviously struck a chord,” I chuckle. I couldn’t stop what they were doing to me, but I could continue to piss them off every step of the way. Like I had previously said, they obviously didn’t want me dead. I struggle to remember what they had said when I was a child, perhaps there would be some sort of clue there. My mind comes up blank, I would have to think about this later, when I was not in some twisted version of my own mind.

“Let’s go over the rules, shall we?”

“First off, stop trying to warn your friends. They can’t help you and if they try, it’s only going to harm you, because it definitely won’t hurt me. Next, stop trying to fight me every step of the way, another thing that will harm you, not me. Unless you like headaches, I suggest you just let me do whatever I want.”

I open my mouth to say something but find that I’m without air. I was learning that even if in the real world I was unaffected, this wasn’t the real world and they could do whatever they wanted here.

“Interrupting me is rude. Next, when the time comes, well just let it come. You remember the feeling, do you not? The feeling of falling into something much grander than your puny little mortal life?”

“What was supposed to happen that day?” I question.

“And lastly, don’t question me,” they state. I growl, and I prepare to ask them another question when the despair from this world suddenly seeps away. I fall to my knees, taking in numerous deep breaths as I try to get my bearings back.

“I know what I said, pet. Do the smart thing for once and just shut up.”

“Let’s go over the rules, shall we?”

The world caused me to feel horrible migraines and each time my eyes moved to another area of the room, I grew dazed and lightheaded. I was still standing in the doorway of the safehouse, but nothing looked the same. I couldn’t hear or see the others, I could barely even feel myself.
		
So, how do I get out of it? That was the question. It seems nearly impossible. Each movement came with a horrible headache and the need to throw up.

“Are you sure this isn&#39;t all in your head?”
		
“It’s not!” I yell, my temper reaching unsurmountable peaks.
		
“Told you it would only make you look worse, can’t even follow the first rule. Being here with you, pet, will be most interesting.” I look at those surrounding me and begin to believe those words.

A prisoner of my own mind. I think of a few things that could possibly upset the Entity. When they don’t react, and I don’t feel like some mystic force has covered me, I feel better. My thoughts were still my own, if they weren’t, then they would be all too eager to prove me wrong.

But there was little else to do, and so they go back into the kitchen.
		
“So, you can follow directions, good,” the Entity hums before going quiet.

In the far distance, I can see the rain clouds. The charcoal clouds are sprawled out, crawling along the sky closer to our destination. The brighter part of the sky shrinks away in fear, being overwhelmed by the doom to come. Here the sun still streams down onto the land, unaware or uncaring of what was moving in.

Besides eyeing the sky, I knew the signs of rain because of the wind. It had picked up and was heavy with the scent of what could be the last rainfall of spring. I close the door, though my worries and thoughts reside on the other side, ready to meet the rain.

“What were some of the signs that your friend brought up?” I question after Sydero had asked about Bradley’s friend, he wasn’t able to give us much information pertaining to the kid besides that he was a gamer and pretty cool.

“Animal killings, mostly dogs. Some of those who talked to the cops said it looked like a large animal. And all the pets were torn apart, almost shredded with hearts gone ... among other things.”

&lt;&lt;link [img[images/divider.png]] &gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/link&gt;&gt;
Sydero is unable to finish as a scream pierces the once cheerful and relaxed air surrounding the park. Dogs bark, children whimper and cry, and parents rush to their kids as they try to figure out what’s happening. We both set off in a sprint, rushing to the source of the piercing scream that has now turned into loud shouts.

&lt;&lt;link [img[images/divider.png]] &gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/link&gt;&gt;
The beast is upon me, swiping his paw towards me and I swing my blade. My blade skids across his paw, creating a deep gash that the creature doesn’t appreciate. It whimpers, its eyes blazing with new hatred for me.
					
It charges again, this time barreling towards me, shoulder first. I time my jump, jumping out of the way and sliding my blade down its flank as I go. He turns around, and I narrowly avoid its claws.

&lt;&lt;link [img[images/divider.png]] &gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/link&gt;&gt;
In the middle sits the bodies of all the dead animals that we had heard about. The decomposing bodies are surrounded by flying insects, enjoying the buffet.
	
“Well, I think we found the animals,” Sydero whispers harshly, looking around for something else.

	I take a step back, looking over the room. Seeing that we were unable to bring any groceries back, and I wasn’t trying to send anyone back out there, cleaning wasn’t exactly easy. I did the best I could. My eyes move from one dirty area to the next, and I sigh. My best hardly put a dent into it though.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	I take a step back, looking over the room, newly cleaned. The dirtiest thing now was the mattress, and whatever rested deep underneath the bed. I wasn’t going to move the heavy thing out of the way so whatever dwelled there would continue to do so. The mattress could be overlooked, especially since I had added a fresh sheet to cover it. I could probably do much more, but Sydero warned us all not to get comfortable. It was her main safehouse, but it was still just that, a safehouse.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

The past few days have been the same, all of us helping to fix the house more and training. Each day I saw progress, and my style grew more uniform and put together. But staying in one place, doing the same thing for too long, it allowed other things to fester and grow as well ...

I continue to make the room acceptable when the window suddenly bursts open, causing me to jump back and hit my back on the bedpost. I immediately hear giddy laughing, letting me know that my previous startle was just a show for another.

“So clumsy, pet.”

“Stop calling me that,” I growl.

“Or what? You’re going to bang your head on the wall till I agree to show myself? You’ll be brain dead before that happens ... but it would be fun to watch.” Their voice echoes through my head, causing a mini headache and slight nausea to take hold. As the echo fades, my senses come back to me. I need to get my mind off of this and onto something else.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	I leave my room, heading towards the kitchen which has for some reason been deemed the place to gather. Like I thought, Sydero sits at the table looking over something on her phone, with Chris in the seat right next to her eating and reading from //The Lore//.
	
	“Anything on the agenda for today?” I ask, taking a seat at the table after grabbing a granola bar.
	
	“You guys can practice some more, but I’m –” Sydero starts when Bradley rushes in with his laptop held delicately in his hands. 
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	I leave my room, heading towards the kitchen which has for some reason been deemed the place to gather. Like I thought, Sydero sits at the table looking over something on her phone, but Bradley is nowhere to be seen.

&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“Hold everything, not another word.” The kitchen falls into silence as we wait for him to continue, “are you guys up for a hunt?”

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“Yes,” Chris and I both shout at the same time. It would seem I wasn’t the only one beginning to go crazy.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“Yes,” I shout, I was going stir crazy just sitting in this place all day. 
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“No.” Sydero’s voice rings out, all of our eyes falling on her. I’m shocked myself, I would think if anybody would want to get up and do something, it’d be her. She doesn’t seem like the type to like to stay in one place for very long.

“Why not?” Bradley whimpers, exaggerating his tone and expression to make it seem like he was genuinely bothered by her words.

“A hunt means I’m not getting paid. I don’t risk my neck for charity,” she says in a gruff voice. She makes sure she avoids eye contact with Bradley, I can’t blame her. The kid’s face was moving even my heart, and I wasn’t the target.

“Come on. A great gamer friend of mine is asking for help, he really sounds like he’s scared.”

“Why is your gamer friend asking you for help with the supernatural?” Sydero counters, raising an accusing brow towards Bradley. He shrinks away, clearing his throat as he glances at the floor.

“Come on, please. He thinks it&#39;s werewolves, we can’t just let that go.”

	“Are you sure you’re okay to go on a hunt, $name?” Chris asks, probably remembering what happened the other day. I wave his worry away and look at the others to see if we were all in agreement.

Sydero grumbles something but otherwise agrees on the trip.

	“Are we even ready to go up against werewolves? We’re still training,” Chris points out, but Sydero immediately shakes her head.
	
	“I’ve taught you the basics. Next step is actually just sharpening your instincts and gaining experience to make you better. This might actually be a good hunt for you to try that.”
	
	“We’re going up against werewolves,” Chris reminds her, and she sneers.
	
	“Even better, you get to think on your toes and fight to survive. I can’t think of a better opportunity.” I could.

“Ahh, nothing serious, I mean just a few things here and there,” his voice trails off as he continues on saying something at an inaudible level. I exchange a knowing glance with Sydero, it would seem that our mutual young friend has said far too much.

“In North Carolina,” he answers right away, “literally next door.”
		
“You say next door as if all we have to do is click our heels together and we’re there,” Sydero huffs.

	We pack up most of our things, not going overboard but enough to where if someone drops by the safehouse, they wouldn’t know a group was living there. I drive, and Bradley navigates, the two children sit in the back arguing about anything they can think of. But their current argument was really taking the cake.
	
	“No one would agree with that!” Chris shouts, as if we all weren’t in a close compact space.
	
	“I don’t care, that doesn’t make it any less possible,” Sydero comes back. I was embarrassed to even know them.
	
	“What are you guys talking about?” Bradley asks, taking a break from going through his dubstep playlist.
	
	“Which fruit would win in a fight.” Bradley pauses, looks over at me, and then turns to look at them.
	
	I was truly hoping he was about to put an end to the stupid argument when he says, “and which did you each say?”

	“I said a watermelon,” Chris states proudly.

	“And I said a pineapple,” Sydero adds in. Bradley takes a minute to think about both and then shakes his head, turning more in his seat to talk to them.

	“Obviously you’re both wrong, grapes would win.” The car erupts into shouts of denial as Bradley tries to explain his positioning, “grapes can split up and then form back up. You kill one and a dozen more still remain.”

	“In what universe?” Chris questions in disbelief.

	“Plus, they would have nothing but defense, you can’t win a fight being nothing but defensive,” Sydero adds.

	“Oh, but your pineapple can kick ass, huh?”

	“Yes. Spiny exterior for defense and it can use its leaves as a weapon, plus it’s not heavy enough to not be able to move at all.” I see her send a long glare to Chris who clears his throat to argue.

	We pack up most of our things, not going overboard but enough to where if someone drops by the safehouse, they wouldn’t know a group was living there. I drive, and Bradley navigates, while Sydero relaxes in the back. The majority of the ride is quiet, our minds all on something else. I attempt to focus mostly on the road but fail, numerous times I escape further within my own mind and think of the Entity. They don&#39;t say anything, and the pulsing, nauseating feeling that I&#39;ve acquainted with them increases over time.

“It’s fine, $name, you didn’t hurt my feelings or anything. Just thinking about where our friendship stands is all.” I roll my eyes at his dramatic nature, and how the argument has now turned to Sydero cussing Chris out about putting his hand over her mouth.

“Bradley said grapes,” I remind them, “grapes!”

“My grapes have numbers on their side,” Bradley shouts as we all try to be heard, “yours only looks intimidating.”

“I say the dragon fruit beats the watermelon easily though,” Syd laughs, earning a rough push from Chris. The entire car was now in an argument that would see no victor.

“What were some of the signs that your friend brought up?” I question after Sydero had asked about Bradley’s friend, he wasn’t able to give us much information pertaining to the kid besides that he was a gamer and pretty cool.

“Animal killings, mostly dogs. Some of those who talked to the cops said it looked like a large animal. And all the pets were torn apart, almost shredded with hearts gone ... among other things.”

“Dogs? Werewolves would eat their ... well, they would eat dogs?” I question, Sydero tapping her chin with a deep frown decorating her face.

“It’s not totally unheard of. Vampires, werecats, and werewolves sometimes turn to animal feeding to stay under the radar, less urgency if you’re killing animals and not humans. But it’s rare, mostly because it’s disgusting to them.”
&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	
	“So, weak werewolves? I don’t see the problem here,” Chris points out.
	
	“Not weak, hungry. Think of a starving pack, finally faced with three people who they won’t get in trouble for killing.” Her words definitely just shifted what Chris and I were envisioning.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“Not much, like I said it’s animal killings so it’s more like, give it to the beginner officer and not an ‘oh crap’ type of thing,” Bradley tells us.

We arrive at the café that Bradley’s friend tells us to meet him at, looking it over before making any moves. Bradley is the first to take a step towards the corner building that is painted a pale pastel teal tone. Above it rests a wall of mahogany bricks that were most definitely apartments. Three wooden tables sit up against the exterior of the café, each with a clear bowl with a single candle inside sitting in the middle.

“Ugh, I hate when I can only count one exit,” I hear Sydero mumble from beside me, glaring at the café in disgust.

[[“You can always break a window.”]]

“Talk to Bradley’s friend at the meeting place and then investigate the latest death. We’ll work from there,” Sydero answers. It wasn’t much of a plan, but I suppose there was only so much we can plan since we didn’t have the entire picture.

“Depends on what the glass is made out of,” Sydero answers, rubbing her chin. Before heading inside, she goes up to one and knocks on it, growling before moving inside.

The inside of the café mirrors the outside in only the classic downtown style that the exterior possessed. All walls were a pristine alabaster tone, accented by dark browns on the ceilings and multicolored wooden slabs that make up the counter and floor. Low indie coffee shop music plays overhead, creating a relaxing and ambient mood.

	“Whoa, what happened to you?” I question, stiffening. I can see the faint sight of blood still rushing out of whatever wound he had acquired.
	
	“This rude ass cat was injured, and I tried to help it, instead it decided to claw me,” he chuckles in embarrassment.
	
	“More like a dumbass guy decided to pet the cat minding its business,” Sydero corrects, relaxing in her seat, cocking her head to the side at Chris. He gets ready to say something when a plump young girl approaches the table confidently.

“It’s totally fine,” Bradley suddenly shouts, clearing his throat when all eyes fall on him. He shrinks in his seat, waving for us to continue on.

“Now, you say you think these are werewolves?” Sydero asks, and Hillary nods.

“I know I’m not really in this world, but after talking to Bradley and looking it up, that’s the best thing I can come up with.”

“The internet lies,” Syd tells her.

I stare at her extended hand, making up my mind not to shake it, nor to introduce myself. She slowly withdraws it and clears her throat.
	
“This rude person is $name,” Bradley tells her, sending me a threatening glare, the first I ever received from him.
		
&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	She turns towards Chris but upon seeing his hand, settles on him just giving her his name.

“I have three dogs that are my life, two of them are too big to always keep in the house and so I’m worried about their safety. Since the attacks started, I’ve kept them inside and only let them outside under supervision, but I can tell that they’re beginning to grow agitated. Plus, I have other friends with pets, and I just don’t think anyone should have to walk outside and see their beloved pet like that.”

“Have these attacks been focused in one area, or spread around town?” Sydero asks. Her phone is out, and I look over to see her fiddling with a map of the town.

“Most of them are on the northwest side of town, but there have been some incidents in other places too.” Sydero jots something down before nodding, standing.

“We’ll take a look around town and see what we can find, we’ll have Bradley update you later.”

“Actually, I think Bradley should stay with Hillary,” I start, sending a mischievous smile to Bradley, “Hillary can show him around town.” Bradley opens his mouth to combat what I say, but Hillary stops him by agreeing with me.
		
“I can show you the arcade, which is basically my second home, and maybe even my setup.” Bradley lights up, his eyes turning into a million glistening stars.
		
“I get to see the setup of //the// EpicGameMaster?” 

She chuckles softly, “you carry the team more often than I do.”

“Lies. Remember that one move you did in the deathmatch? When it was four versus two, and we still weren’t even close to the objective?” Sydero motions for us to go, smirking at the two as they seem to have forgotten the world around them.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\

Sydero draws a circle around the neighborhood where the most attacks have been, not that far away actually. “This is where the attacks are concentrated. We can focus our efforts here first.”

“Do you think they’ll be in the woods again?” I question her.

“Maybe, but there’s a good chance that they’re living in a regular house. We don’t know how many werewolves we’re working with here.” She bites the inside of her cheek, for the first time ever, seeming uncomfortable and nervous.

If they’re bothered about the recent attacks, they don’t show it. They laugh and continue on with their lives as if everything was fine.

We park at the local park, staying near my car as we people watch. I’m starting to see why this neighborhood has the most attacks, it seems like everyone has a pet here. I see some people with exotic pets, while others simply walk with their dogs and cats.

“You ever have a pet, Roe?” Sydero asks. I was currently leaning on the side of my car while she leans against the hood.

[[“Does a goldfish count?”]]

	“Of course,” I chuckle, “I feel weird, never owning a pet before.”
			
	“Not that weird. My parents had a chihuahua who practically drove me crazy. I learned soon after that I was a big dog type of person. When I volunteered at the animal shelter, they were the nicest ones. Sucks that they’re the first to be put down though.”
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“What about you, Syd? You a dog person?” I ask.
		
“Yes, cos who doesn’t want a giant hairy beast stomping around their house, shitting wherever they like?” Sydero asks, I can practically hear her rolling her eyes.

“Beautiful day, huh?” I say, starting off with the only icebreaker I really know.
		
“When are you people going to leave us alone?” he asks under his breath.
		
“Excuse me?”
		
“You and all those other curious young’uns that are just popping up. You don’t care that this town is grieving, you just want to be nosy.”

	“Not only do you insult my intelligence, but you make it seem like you’re different than the others. Leave a man, fore I shoot you like I did that animal stalking round my home,” he shouts, and eyes swing towards us. His dog is now on his feet and is baring his canines. I immediately get up, taking one cautious step back, and then another. Once I’m a reasonable distance away, his dog lies back down, and at the same time, they look towards the woods.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	He turns to look at me, narrowing his eyes and studying me. His face finally calms, and his dog licks my hand sadly before taking his attention off of me.

	“Gosh I’m sorry, it’s just, I’ve gotten more folks talkin’ to me now than I feel like I ever have. What’s killin’ the pets? What’s out there? Did you see it, do you know? Probably cos I’m an old man. Guess I’m supposed to be knowledgeable about these things.”

	“What do you tell them? To get lost?” I ask, snickering.

	“At first no, I told em honestly what I knew, which ain’t much. And then, when I saw the trend, I just decided to be that old man that everyone calls a grouch.” He looks away from me and back toward the woods.

	“What do you think it is?” I inquire.

	“I don’t know,” he sighs, “the other day I shot at the damn thing, don’t know if I hit it or not though. This happened when I was a young&#39;un too. Oh, me and Jenkins here lost his father to whatever happened. I think it’s a wild animal, the only thing that makes a lick of sense. My dad went out with some other men to shoot it, said they did. It was a cougar. We don’t get those around here, bobcats sure but not no cougar.” I nod, relaxing in the seat before thanking the man and patting the head of his dog. With that, I get up and head back towards my car to rendezvous with the others.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
I walk over to the woman with two calm cats at the end of her leash. They pay me no mind as I come to stand beside the woman, making sure to get her attention before I start asking any kind of questions.
	
“I don’t think I’ve ever seen cats be walked,” I begin, pointing down to them.
		
“They aren’t trained for it or anything, but this is the only way I can get them out of the house now,” she tells me, her eyes lowering to her two lazy cats. “But then I can’t let them off of the leash because of the dogs, not all these dogs are cat-friendly.”
		
“I’m guessing you’re nervous because of all those animal attacks?” I inquire, and she nods, “I thought only dogs were being attacked.”
		
“No, there’s been an assortment of animals, even wildlife animals that have been found.”
		
“Really?”
		
“Yes. A deer here and a fox there but nothing like the pet attacks. A good amount of the attacks has been against dogs, but there’s been some cats, mostly strays but nevertheless.”
		
“Has anyone attempted to hunt it yet?”
		
“I wouldn’t know, I’m quite the animal lover and I do think all animals deserve the right to live. But ... I can’t help but fear that it’ll begin attacking more frequently and that it’ll add us to its diet. Even I’m not too proud – or stupid – to recognize that one animal’s life is not worth hundreds of others. I mean, what kind of animal needs that much food? It&#39;s hunted tons of animals so far, shouldn’t it be full by now?”

I agree with her words, carefully reaching down to pat the cat closest to me. It allows it, but I notice that both cats&#39; behavior seem somber. I thank her and head back towards the car to meet up with the others.

&lt;&lt;set $boyanddog = true&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
A little boy captures my attention. All around him are other little kids, running around with their dogs or playing on the nearby playground. Yet here he sits, his arms around the dog’s neck as he keeps it close. The dog whines and will attempt to move away from the boy but that only causes the hold to tighten. He buries his face into the dog’s furry neck, whispering something I can’t hear.
		
“Why don’t you play with the other kids?” I ask him, giving him my friendliest smile. He bites the inside of his cheek as I guess he judges my ‘stranger’ levels, his eyes wandering to the other kids.
		
“I want to,” he begins, “but I can’t leave Muse by herself, she’ll –” The boy catches himself, gulping in fear as his head jerks and he stares at the nearby forest.
		
“What’s wrong? Why can’t Muse be by herself? The other dogs look like they’re just fine,” I point out. He gazes around and then leans towards me as if we were conspiring.
		
“You gotta promise not to tell anyone,” he starts, and I nod. I suppose my nod must’ve not been enough for him, for he shakes his head, his nose scrunching up. “You won’t believe me, mommy doesn’t.”
		
“I’ve seen some weird things too.”
		
“This isn’t a dream,” he tells me bluntly, perhaps his mother’s words.
		
“The weird things I see aren’t in dreams,” I tell him.
		
“Of course not, you’re perfectly sane,” the Entity laughs, the sound echoing throughout my mind. I jump at the sound of their voice, I had almost forgotten that they were living in my head now, they had been silent for so long. The boy leans in even closer, his dog whimpering and the boy responds by loosening his grip.
		
“There’s a monster in the woods behind my house. It was staring at Muse while she was using the bathroom. And then that night I saw it outside of my window. It’s really big and has blue eyes and sharp fangs.” The boy shivers, and Muse whimpers, nuzzling the boy affectionately. “It wants to eat Muse ... or me.” I imagine a beast staring at the little boy, understanding the nightmares that probably followed him that night. From what he described, the beast sounds intelligent, but the sharp fangs and blue eyes have me at a loss. Could that still be a werewolf?
		
“Is that what&#39;s been killing all the dogs?” I ask, and he nods quickly, his eyes going back to the woods. I thank the child for telling me his secret and head back to the car where we agreed to meet back up at.

	Sydero is already there when I arrive, and a few minutes later, Chris shows up.

	“So, did anyone discover anything that was actually helpful?” Syd questions, picking at a single strand of dog hair on her shirt. She releases it with a disgusted grimace, “because that mom had nothing to offer me but her life story.”

	“I was talking to some teens who say that it’s nothing but some predator who got brave enough to enter backyards,” Chris reports.

			“So, what do we have so far?” Chris asks.
			
			“A lot of unsubstantial information. Everything we know can fit a werewolf packs MO, but it’s not typical werewolf behavior. Yet there’s nothing else that –” 
		&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
			“Well, I talked to an old man who thinks he managed to shoot it, and said this isn’t the first time that this had happened. When he was a kid something similar took place. I’m guessing that means the pack might have made this their permanent home. Is that normal?”
			
			“Nothing about this is normal,” Sydero sighs, “but like I said before, it’s not –”
		&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
	&lt;&lt;elseif $catlady&gt;&gt;\
		“I talked to a woman with cats, she said that it’s not just dogs, stray cats have gone missing and that some wildlife animals have been found as well.”
		
		“This thing seems to have a large diet,” Chris points out.
		
		“Yea, or it’s just multiple stomachs that need feeding. If this pack is large, then all the killing –”
	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
		“I talked to a little boy who said he saw it. He described it having blue eyes, sharp fangs, huge, and smart enough to find his window and stare inside his room at him.”
		
		“I’ve never heard of a werewolf having blue eyes,” Sydero starts, rubbing her chin as if a beard resides there, “but from what he described it does sound like it would be a –”
	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
	
	Sydero is unable to finish as a scream pierces the once cheerful and relaxed air surrounding the park. Dogs bark, children whimper and cry, and parents rush to their kids as they try to figure out what’s happening. The three of us set off in a sprint, rushing to the source of the piercing scream that has now turned into loud shouts.
	
	Once there, we each recoil from the sight. A dog – or what’s left of one – lies on the outskirts of a nearby forest, his body ripped to pieces and his entrails leading a trail towards the tree line. His upper half is no longer in sight, and one can only imagine that it can be found in the forest.
	
	“Stay back,” Sydero growls, roughly shoving an older man out of the way as she marches towards the trees, disappearing within. Chris looks around and spots the origins of the scream, a preteen on their knees, crying.

[[Look around.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="926" name="Go with Sydero." tags="" position="1351,4016" size="100,100">I rush after Sydero, heading into the woods after making sure no one else would follow. Most of them seem too shaken up to think about doing so, while everyone else has long since fled the park.
		
There is no visible trail, and the grass here gradually begins to rise in length, along with difficulty in navigating it.
	
“No small creature could get far in this, especially if dragging something,” I say aloud.
		
“Agreed, unless it has freakishly long legs or neck to hold the object up,” I hear Sydero say. I pick up my pace and spot her, her ability to navigate the terrain rivaled mine.
		
“How do you know it went this way?” I question.
		
“Tips of the grass, there’s blood and ... other things.” I look down at the grass and sure enough see small crimson liquid sparkling under the sunlight, as well as ... the other things. We continue on, following the blood until we come to a small clearing where the rest of the dog lies. Similar to its other body part, this half was ripped to pieces and nothing but some fur and bone remain.
		
“Look at that,” Sydero begins, pointing to some ripped off fur with deep claw marks. “These aren’t canine marks.”
		
“What do you mean?”
		
“Canine claws are dull to a point because they’re always out, the marks they leave don’t look like this. This looks more feline than anything.”
		
“A werecat?” I&#39;ve heard of the beast, but I was curious to see what they looked like, as well as what they would turn into.
		
“No, doesn’t fit with them either. I’d say it’s a werewolf before a werecat,” Sydero fixes. She sits back on her heel and closes her eyes, taking multiple deep breaths. I watch her quietly, wondering if I should bring up her recent behavior.

[[Ask her about it.]]
[[Wrap this up and get back.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="927" name="Go with Chris." tags="" position="1351,4121" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;set $withchris = true&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
I join Chris and approach the preteen who holds a leash close to her heart.
		
“I’m sorry for your loss,” Chris starts, kneeling down beside her slowly. He wobbles a bit before balancing himself. With tear-soaked eyes, she glances up at Chris and I, thanking us quietly.
		
“Did you see what happened? What took it ... what did that?” I ask, my eyes slowly moving back to the sliced up half-carcass. She shakes her head furiously, her ponytail hitting her cheeks harshly as she does it.
		
“I was calling her to come back when I heard her whimpering and growling. When I got over here, I just saw a big massive blur disappear into the woods and saw, that.” She sniffles, wrapping her arms around herself. “I heard about the attacks, but only that something had killed some dogs, I didn’t know it did that.”
		
“Excuse me,” Chris growls, quickly rising to his feet and walking off with purpose. He looks sick, ready to vomit.
		
“What can do that to a dog?” she whispers, her sobs coming back, but this time she sounds angrier. This creature had no right to take away her beloved dog, and the despair that rests in her eyes would only turn to fury. It’s a good thing I was here to help eliminate the problem, but I wondered how messy this would get since this being’s head was wanted by the town.
		
I give her my condolences one last time before turning to find Chris, not being able to spot him in the immediate vicinity. But perhaps that was for the best, I’d hate to be walking and accidentally step into his vomit.

&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
I approach the preteen who holds a leash close to her heart, as well as a bloody hand.
		
“I’m sorry for your loss,” I start, kneeling down beside her. I peek at her hand, “what happened?”
		
“That thing!” she shouts in hatred, “I was calling my dog to come back when I heard her whimpering and growling. When I got over here, I just saw a big massive blur and went to kick it when it did this. It then just disappeared into the woods and I saw, that.” She sniffles, wrapping her arms around herself, spreading the blood on her clothes. “I heard about the attacks, but only that something had killed some dogs, I didn’t know it did that.”
		
“What can do that to a dog?” she whispers, “look what it did to me!” She thrusts her hand out, four long scratches on the back of her hand. I tell her to wait for me and rush back to my car to grab some gauze. I wrap up her injury and give her my number for any more information. She was in mourning and pain, there was a lot of things she might have forgotten. 
		
I give her my condolences one last time before walking back to the car, waiting for Sydero to rejoin me.

&lt;&lt;set $claw = true&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
I go my own way, curious about what the surrounding area near the initial attack might hold. I wait until most of the crowd has left, the mood of the park now somber and quiet as families leave.
	
&lt;&lt;if $oldman&gt;&gt;\
	I catch sight of the older gentleman from earlier and his dog, both are sitting in the same place they were before, staring off at the woods that the beast had come out of. I would say it’ s possible they saw something, but the man doesn’t appear shaken up, only sad.
&lt;&lt;elseif $boyanddog&gt;&gt;\
	I catch sight of the little boy and his dog, Muse. Who I assume is his father is ushering him away from the scene, towards a waiting car. The boy doesn’t fight, but he keeps glimpsing back towards the woods. His gaze travels over to me, and we stare at one another, his eyes growing before he turns his back to me.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	I catch sight of the woman and the two cats. She’s holding both of them, and I notice that they&#39;re both hissing in the direction of the woods.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

I walk to the poor mangled animal, a smell beginning to form. I wonder who would come out here to clean this up, who cleaned up most of the attacks. They were probably numb to the sight by now, but I can only imagine what their first reaction was. My eyes glance over the body one more time when I spot something glistening, the sun hitting it perfectly so that it catches my attention.
		
I lean down and pick it up, finding a slightly curved and large tip of a black claw. Probably chipping when the creature managed to separate the dog into two.

	The three of us meet back up at the car, Chris looking even more sickly than before.
	
	“Are you sure you should be on your feet, Chris?” I question, noticing that he seems much paler as well.
	
	“I’m fine, just feeling kinda weird is all,” he reassures us, though it’s not exactly reassuring. Sydero and I exchange a glance.
	
	&lt;&lt;if $withchris&gt;&gt;\
		“Anyway, did you guys discover anything useful because we’re working with the bare minimum right now,” Sydero states, crossing her arms impatiently.
		
		“Just that the girl is pretty upset, and she saw a massive blur before it took off into the woods,” I recall.

		“So, nothing, great. Worst hunt ever,” Sydero shouts, getting into the car like an upset toddler.
	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
	&lt;&lt;if $claw&gt;&gt;\
		“Oh yea, I did find this.” I reach into my pocket and throw the claw her way. She easily catches it and turns it over multiple times as she studies it.

		“Ever seen it before?” I question.

		“The good thing is that this isn’t a werewolf’s claw, but ...”

		“But?”

		“It could be a werecat’s.”

		“Oh crap, I’m going to finally see one?”

		“I said could. The horrible thing about werecats is that they turn into whatever large cat has scratched them, unlike the werewolf who simply turns into a wolf.”
		
		&lt;&lt;if $oldman&gt;&gt;\

				“Well dang Roe, you’re proving to be actually more helpful than I thought.”
			&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
		&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
	“Let’s go get a motel room, and grab Bradley, we can figure out the rest later. I need a bed,” Sydero states and both Chris and I agree.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	&lt;&lt;if $withgirl&gt;&gt;\
		“Anything?” Syd asks at the car.
		
		“I talked to the girl who saw it, she also got scratched. All she said was that it was massive and fast, ran back into the woods. I gave her my number in case she thinks of anything else.”
		
		“What did the scratches look like?”

		“They were deep, and she had four of them, I can’t really say what animal if that’s what you’re asking.”

		“If they were deep then the claw is curved slightly, it’s better for gripping but will do horrible things to someone who’s moving their hand away at the same time.”

		“That’s great, but it gets us nowhere closer to figuring out what’s going on, or what we’re after.”

		“It actually does,” Sydero corrects, “werewolves don’t have curved claws, but werecats do.” So, a werecat, I couldn’t lie and say I wasn’t interested in seeing one in person.
	&lt;&lt;elseif $claw&gt;&gt;\
		“Anything?” Syd asks at the car.

		“Yea, I found this near the rear end of the dog’s carcass,” I begin, reaching into my pocket and pulling out the black claw that I had found. I pass it to Sydero who turns it over a few times.

		“Ever seen it before?” I question.

		“The good thing is that this isn’t a werewolf’s claw, but ...”

		“But?”

		“It could be a werecat’s.”

		“We really don’t have anything concrete to go after,” I remind Sydero once we make it to the car and she waves my words away, not wanting to be reminded of the lack of information.
	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
	
	“So, what next?”
	
	“Let’s head back to Bradley and see if he found anything.” I nod, and we both get in the car, driving back towards the café.

Even more mysterious than usual? A bit depressing? I really don’t know the word to use, mostly because all of those already described her personality, just something was off now.
				
“I have no idea what you’re referring to.” It’s only when she says this that I finally figure out how to describe her new attitude.
				
“You’re less mean. I mean you’re still rude, but you haven’t insulted me for a while now, which is definitely weird. Ever since that meet up with Raum at the restaurant.” I stop, watching as her pupils flee to the corner of her eye. “Are you scared of him?” She scoffs loudly, truly looking insulted.

“I could beat Raum in my sleep if I wanted to, it’s whoever sent him that bothers me. And I’m not feeling my best which might just prove to be the thing that gets us.” Not only did she answer the question, further proving that there was something wrong with her, but she also admitted to being weak, even if just for this moment.

It was a good attempt, but the fire residing in her eyes was weak and I’m sure it took every intimidating muscle she had to conjure it.

Suddenly she’s in front of me, and my back is to a tree, her hand on my chest as she keeps me in place. She narrows her eyes but the fire that once rested there is extinguished. She sighs and shakes her head, removing her hand and going back the way we came in. I watch her, wondering what caused her to suddenly shift like that, but I don’t question it for long, quickly catching up and following her out.

	The day is spent with us researching, telling Chris to lie down, and more researching. The time gets away from me when I&#39;m startled awake by a nearby sound. I pick my head up from the table, seeing Sydero grab her wallet and head towards the door.
	
	“Where are you going?”
	
	“There’s a bar not too far off, walking distance. I need a drink,” she tells me, looking over at Chris who is clutching a pillow firmly in his grasp, his back to us. Now I know something was wrong, he would generally leap at something like this.
	
	“You in?” Sydero asks me, opening the door.
	
	“I’ll keep an eye on him,” Bradley tells us, and I nod to him and then to Sydero, grabbing my ID and wallet.

It wasn’t as classy as the last bar I worked at, which was more of a relief due to the impending memories in my mind, waiting to have a good enough reason to spring themselves on me. But the atmosphere of the bar was friendly, everyone seemed to either mind their business or knew the others.

I follow Syd to the bar area, looking at the large-scale menu that rests between the shelves of alcohol on the wall.

“Hmm, am I in the mood for bourbon or straight up whiskey?” Sydero says to herself, rubbing her chin in thought. It was a movement that I was seeing more and more of, especially today. Whenever she was thinking, mind focused on one thing, the action took place.

“What you’ll have?” the bartender asks, stopping in front of Sydero and I. Further down the bar another patron calls out for him, officially putting us on a time limit. I know how frustrated patrons were at bars, especially when they had one too many.

“Jack Daniels whiskey neat for me, uh, lemonade back,” Sydero answers, gazing over at me next.

[[“I’ll just have a glass of lemonade.”]]
[[“I’ll take a beer and a shot of the Jameson Irish Whiskey.”]]
[[“Long Island Ice Tea.”]]

&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
I see Sydero roll her eyes, shaking her head lightly at my order. The bartender nods and goes to see what the other customer needed, leaving us to speak.
		
“Seriously? You could’ve stayed back at the motel if you were just going to order lemonade.”
		
“Maybe I wanted to give you some company.”
		
“I’m a lone drinker,” she corrects.
		
&lt;&lt;if $sydero &gt;= 50&gt;&gt;\
	“Wow, did that sound more depressing in your head or out loud?” She rolls her eyes but can’t help the carefree smile that appears.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“Wow, did that sound more depressing in your head or out loud?” She rolls her eyes, sighing in disgust as she looks around.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

We wait for our order and then grab a table that’s farther away from everyone else, tucked away in a dimly lit corner. A green neon sign with the words Unhappy Hour, rests above the table, offering it its light source.

The first few minutes, we drink in silence. People watching and drinking in relative peace. The thoughts of the day are pushed to the side, along with the creature we’re hunting along with it.

“Drink from the young man right there,” a waitress says, placing a drink in front of Syd. She points to a young man who raises his glass towards her, giving her a friendly smile.

“Cute,” Syd chuckles, picking up the drink and looking at it, she twists it around in her hand and then sniffs it, “but I don’t do cocktails.” Sydero hands the drink back and the waitress nods before taking the drink back with her, telling the man what Syd had told her. Syd watches the exchange, smirking and looking over at me.

“You know, once upon a time I would’ve accepted the drink just because of what it meant.”

“What do you mean?”

“Sex,” she says simply, shrugging at the look I give her, “no strings, half-drunken sex. What? You’ve never done meaningless hookups?”

“Enough,” I tell her. Now, whether I was truthful or not was my own business, the tone in which she asked the question was already dripping with judgment, “why?”

“Yep, plenty. It’s kinda weird,” she admits, “I got it off of the first person I killed, but the blade is uniquely mine.

	Chris whimpers in his sleep, clutching the pillow closer towards him. It was so hot, why the hell was it so hot? He shoots up, looking around what should’ve been a dark room, but he was able to see so clearly. This was more than just his eyes adjusting to the darkness, this was an immediate adjustment. He could make out what some words said, halfway across the room. His senses twitched at the garbled noise coming from the table. His head jerks towards the sound, seeing Bradley slumped against the table, asleep. Good, the kid never slept.
	
	Chris could smell the disgusting smell of whatever energy drink Bradley had decided to chug. In fact, if he focused, he could smell cheap Chinese food as well, next door perhaps? A searing pain shoots through him, stopping in his head and causing him to clutch it in agony. What was happening? Everything hurt. And it was so hot. And ... he was incredibly hungry. But for what? The food he seemed to be craving wasn’t something he was familiar with. He couldn’t even put a name to what he was wanting. But he could smell it, it wasn’t inside the room, but it was still nearby.

	In fear and curiosity, he goes to the door, opening it and sniffing the air. His senses are bombarded with various smells, and though he fails to find the smell, something else peaked his interest. A call on the wind, almost sounding like a loving whimper, calling him forth. It lulled his heart, the agony of not being able to go to it pained him more than anything else. He heard the sorrowful sound again, and this time he didn’t fight it, this time he went to it. He didn’t know where he was going, but he was following a sound that reminded him of home.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“I’m so sorry this happened, Winfrey,” her mother said, wiping the tears that had managed to be shed away. Winfrey heard her mother, but it wasn’t like she was listening, between the pain of this scratch and the loss of her dog, she didn’t know what to do. She glares down at her arm, thinking that she sees it pulsing, but it couldn’t be, right? She whimpers, clutching the pillow closer towards her. As if high school wasn’t hard enough, now she had to go through it with all of these problems to face. She felt like her world was unraveling.
	
	She flips from one side to the other, kicking the blanket away, but it did nothing. She rips off her shirt with a strength that she didn’t know she possessed. It was so hot, why the hell was it so hot? Next came her pants, but she felt no different. Winfrey shoots up, looking around what should’ve been a dark room, but here she was, able to see around it clearly. This was more than just her eyes adjusting to the darkness, this was an immediate adjustment. She could make out what some words said, halfway across the room.
	
	She sniffed the air, being able to make out what smelled like chicken and corn coming from the kitchen. But she could also make out the putrid smell of beer, she could hear it swishing around in the small bottle it came in. And if she stressed her senses more, could hear her father swallow it down. A searing pain shoots through her head, causing her to clutch it in agony. What was happening? Everything hurt. And it was still so hot. And ... she was incredibly hungry. But for what? The food she seemed to be craving wasn’t something she was familiar with. The smell of the food in the kitchen was the farthest thing from what her insides were craving. She couldn’t even put a name to what she was wanting. But she could smell it, it wasn’t inside the house, but it was nearby.
	
	In fear and curiosity, she goes to her window, opening it and sniffing the air. Her senses are bombarded with various smells, and though she fails to find the scent, something else piqued her interest. A call on the wind, almost sounding like a loving whimper, calling her forth. It lulled her heart, the agony of not being able to go to it pained her more than anything else. She heard the sorrowful sound again, and this time she didn’t fight it, this time she went to it.

“How many times will I have to answer the same questions? I already told you I don’t know much about them. Petri and Langston, I’ve seen before but only because they’ve been on my trail for some time, I just recently found out that Raum is leading them.”
		
“Yea, but the big question is whose leading him? Who conjured him? And are seriously unsure about who would want your head?”
		
“I piss tons of people off every year, Roe, it’s an extremely long list,” Sydero chuckles, swirling the alcohol around in the shot glass.
		
“Why do you sound like it doesn’t bother you?”
		
“I doubt some random witch or vamp is going to hire a demonic bounty hunter, I have a feeling I know,” she suddenly stops, scrunching up her nose as she looks over at me, “just let it go. It’s my problem, not yours.”
		
“But –”
		
“Let. It. Go,” she growls deeply. I close my mouth, and she takes another shot, next grabbing the bottle and chugging a quarter of it down. The conversation seems to end there, and I let it, finishing off my drink and just enjoying the ambiance of the bar.

“I don’t see what my age has to do with not wanting to have some pointless relationship. Better yet, why are you so concerned with my romantic life? Hmm?”
		
I fumble with my words as I try to answer her question, I had ninety-nine responses, but an answer to her question was not one. And to make matters worse, that flirty smirk of hers appears, and she leans towards me. “We might as well talk about your consistent flirting while we’re on this particular subject.” She pops the p like one would do a piece of bubblegum, my eyes immediately traveling to her lips. No! Wrong thing to get distracted by right now.
		
“Let’s talk about your consistent flirting,” I shoot back, my mind immediately reprimanding me for the lame comeback as soon as it leaves my mouth.
		
“I won’t sit here and say that I don’t flirt back, I see no point in lying,” she says, leaning back in her seat, “I find you extremely attractive, especially when you’re all hot and bothered.”
	
“Oh, so you’re just a big tease who likes seeing reactions,” I state in mock understanding, rolling my eyes at the thought.
		
“Whoa,” Syd chuckles, her head lazily rolling to one side, bumping up against the cushion of the booth, “don’t get me confused with someone who’s afraid to go past second base. You should be honored, I have too much respect for you in //that// manner to treat you like I would one of these ...” she trails off, her eyes going from one person in the bar to another. I study her face, seeing her eyes alight with that desire that she never wished to tempt further. She doesn’t finish her sentence, never finishing the thought and coming up with a word for those she entices into bed.
		
[[“Maybe I still want to see what past second base looks like.”]]
[[“Just because you think I should feel honored, doesn’t mean I do.”]]

She throws me a lopsided grin, “down, Roe, you can barely handle second base, let alone anything past it.”

“Try me.” In the blink of an eye, she’s in front of me, her frame leaning over me. My head rests up against the wall that the booth is pushed up against, my arm resting on the table supporting me. The majority of her body rests between my legs as she leans closer. Part of me wonders if anyone is watching, but the dimness and how far off this booth is, probably not. That and even if they could see us, we were probably another drunken couple to them.

I’m aware that I’m shivering uncontrollably, heat rising off of me, and my lower body tingling in anticipation. Her face is inches from mine, her lips right next to my ear.

“We’re hardly standing on second base, Roe,” she whispers, “and yet you haven’t stopped shivering, and I can practically hear your body screaming.” The way she whispers the words makes my core shake, my heart speeding up considerably.

“You can’t judge how far I can go based off of my reactions,” I manage to squeak out, and in response, she nibbles my earlobe teasingly, her other hand gripping my thigh.

[[Kiss her.]]

“What I’m saying is, maybe I don’t care about you thinking I feel honored. Maybe I don’t care about feeling honorable at all.” 

She cocks her head as she studies me, “so are you saying you want me to treat you like how I see the rest of them?” I bite the inside of my cheek, not really knowing what that would entail or mean. But she waves whatever I was about to say away, “impossible. I don’t know them, don’t want to know them. Don’t care what their name is. To me, they’re Person One, Person Two, and so on. I know you, not to mention have to deal with your annoying ass. You’re Roe, not number five, so it’s not possible.”

“Then don’t think about it as me being just some random person who you happen to know. See me for me.”
				
“This entire conversation is stupid,” Syd huffs, “you couldn’t handle me anyway.”

“Try me.” In the blink of an eye, she’s in front of me, her frame leaning over me. My head rests up against the wall that the booth is pushed up against, my arm resting on the table supporting me.

I turn my head, capturing her lips in mine. I don’t know what to expect when she stiffens. For her to draw back, more so out of shock than anything else, or for her to let the kiss happen. She does the latter, but she stays stiff. Despite her stiffness, she deepens the kiss. It transitions from an ordinary kiss to one so much deeper, a kiss of exploration and curiosity. 

Each second pulls me deeper into a sea of dark desire. My mind swarms with thoughts that refuse to slow, each time I think I can focus, I’m pulled right back. How a kiss could make me feel like a ship being thrashed around during a storm, I don’t know. I’ve never had such a thing happen to me.

And suddenly it ends. The storm clouds clear up, and my mind settles, my ability to focus is gifted back to me. The only thing telling me that the kiss actually happened is my rapid breathing and my fast beating heart.

I look directly ahead, curious why Syd has suddenly stopped the kiss. Was it me? Did I do something? Her gaze is slanted down, a vexed and conflicting look painting her features.

“Syd?” I say quietly, and her eyes meet mine. My heart trips over itself, a bright red color is slowly retreating from her eye. It blends in with the amber perfectly, looking as if someone had just slowly begun to pour it into her eyes. She sighs and clenches her eyes closed, balling up her fists. She grabs the bottle and chugs the rest of it down.

“I need a drink,” she growls, stalking off, leaving me utterly bewildered.

“Like I said, barely second base.” Her eyes linger on me for a minute, and I’m able to make out a bright red color fade back into amber. She heads back over to her spot on the booth, taking another shot.

I snort at the thought, glancing over at Sydero and choosing to mimic her walking for fun.
		
“What are you doing, Roe?” she questions.
	
“I’m acting like you. Oh, look at me, I’m Sydero, and I’m a heartless witch who doesn’t care about anything or anyone. Everything is stupid.” Sydero stops, raising a brow at my behavior.
		
“That’s very funny,” she says plainly, walking past me. I yawn, following behind her sleepily.
	
&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	I wake up at what I think is the middle of the night, shooting forward and immediately being met by a pulsing headache. I growl, slowly falling back to the bed with all of its plushness.

	“Aww, drinking is stupid, so stupid,” I growl, loud enough for the others to hear me.

	“Sober up, Roe,” Sydero barks. I open my eye and look their way, seeing only Sydero and Bradley standing there. Due to all of my movement, I know Chris isn’t in the bed with me, but the other bed is neatly made.

	“Where’s Chris?” I question.

	“No clue, I woke up and he was gone. He’s not picking up his phone or anything,” Bradley tells me, and this wakes me up.

	“You mean he just ran off?” I shout, shooting up but then I remember why that was such a bad idea. I whimper and melt back to the bed.

	“Yes, now go take a cold shower so we can get you sober, we need to find him.” I’m about to ask how Sydero doesn’t feel like ultimate shit but I keep it to myself, heading to the showers.

	We enter the motel, and the first thing we’re met with is Bradley’s frantic face.
			
	“Oh, thank god, I lost the grown man,” Bradley tells us immediately, yanking both of us into the motel room where he begins pacing back and forth.

	“Calm down, Bradley, what happened?”

	“I was tired, and I finally fell asleep,” he starts, and I interrupt by clapping. The kid never slept, whatever happened can be forgiven as long as he got some shut-eye. “And when I woke up, Chris was gone, and the door was wide open. I tried calling him, but he’s not picking up.”
			
	“When did I sign up for this level of babysitting?” Sydero asks, shaking her head in disapproval. She straightens up, pointing at Bradley, “track Chris’s location by his phone. Roe and I will head out and try to find him.” I grab my keys, and Sydero puts her hand out, stopping me dead in my steps.

	“Are you sure you can drive?”

	“I had one or two shots Sydero, with lemonade, I’m fine.”

	“You already drive crazy though.”

	“Ugh, just come on,” I growl, walking past her and outside.

“Whoa, stop walking so fast,” I tell her, taking off into a run. Suddenly I can no longer – wait no there she is. Each step brings a bigger smile to my face, and my mind begins to wander until I don’t even know where it is.

		I search the streets of the neighborhood slowly, looking for any signs of Chris. Well, I was trying to nurse this hangover first. Thankfully, we had found a 24/7 store and was able to buy a decent energy drink for the time being. With each tick of the clock, the pressure of my headache was being alleviated, but it was doing so slowly.
		
		“You alive over there?” Syd asks, her voice right beside me, yet also a thousand miles away. I tune back into my surroundings, looking over at her as she cruises down another street.
		
		“Why did I do this to myself? And how are you not feeling worse? You chugged the entire bottle at one point.”
		
		“My tolerance for alcohol is supernatural,” she chuckles lightheartedly, “and it always feels good in the moment. Let’s be honest, no one drinks hardcore alcohol because it tastes good.” I growl in agreement, blinking a couple of times to get refocused.
		
		“This is a waste of gas. We’re never going to find Chris like this,” I tell her.
	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
		I search the streets of the neighborhood slowly, looking for any signs of Chris. Further discussion with Sydero and Bradley has led us to consider him possibly turning into whatever we were after. The thought was a particularly unnerving one, imagining Chris either dying due to this or actually turning into a supernatural being.
	
		“Hey!” Syd suddenly shouts, and I tune back into my surroundings, realizing that I was going fifty in a suburban neighborhood. I slow down immediately and give her a small smile.
		
		“This is a waste of gas. We’re never going to find Chris like this,” I tell her, bringing the car to a complete stop in front of someone’s house. Hopefully, they were asleep.
	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

	Syd opens her mouth to reply when her phone goes off, vibrating in the cupholder that she had rested it in.
	
	“Bradley? Please tell me you have something, besides he’s somewhere on the same road as us,” Sydero inquires, almost sounding like she was whimpering. I motion for her to put him on speaker and lean in.
	
	“Well, this has less to do with his location and more to do about what might be happening to him.”
	
	“We’re all ears, Bradley,” I state.
	
	“Well, I did some research and couldn’t really find anything until I went deeper. Their&#39;s a legend around it that might either be true or not, but the locals call it the Bladenboro Beast.” Bradley gets quiet, probably wanting his words to sink in.
	
	“Not very creative if you ask me,” Sydero mumbles, playing with the windows, “what else did you learn?”
	
	“Not much. Legend says that the beast is some large creature that feeds on animal hearts. A couple of years ago it was attacking and those that claim to have seen it always claim that it’s massive, walks on all fours, has blue eyes, and sharp fangs. Everyone thought that they killed it when the locals killed a large cougar and the killing stopped, but no one was one-hundred percent sure.”
	
	[[“So, why did the killings stop?”]]
	[[“So, is it a werecat or not?”]]
	[[“This doesn’t help us find Chris!”]]
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	I hear a voice on the edge of my consciousness, one that grows louder and louder the more I ignore it. At one point, I fear it’s the Entity, reminding me of his presence, something that I had forgotten about.
	
	Yet, it ends up being Sydero, hitting me harshly with a pillow when I refuse to wake.
	
	&lt;&lt;if $hangover&gt;&gt;\
		“Stop it!” I shout, or that’s what I mean to say. I hear my words come out entirely different and when I go to grab the pillow, I’m about five seconds too slow. Sydero moves it back and thwacks me with it again.
		
		“Hangover Roe is almost as much fun as Drunk Roe,” she smirks.
		
		“What do you want?” I ask, fighting the headache that I was now getting, and it wasn’t because of her hitting me.

		“Bradley has something,” she tells me, her eyes moving to Bradley who, of course, is furiously typing at his laptop.
	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
		“Stop it!” I shout, grabbing the pillow from her when she attempts to hit me a third time. I slam the pillow on the bed and glare at her, “what do you want?”
		
		“Bradley has something,” she tells me, her eyes moving to Bradley who, of course, is furiously typing at his laptop.
	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
	
	“Go ahead, Bradley.”
	
	He nods, “I just picked up police chatter, a parent just found out that their daughter isn’t home. At first, they thought she just snuck out, but no one who knows her has seen her. Parents said that she was scratched by something and since then has been acting funny.”
	
	“Just something? No idea what?”
	
	“They think it was a stray cat. I won’t know unless I see the markings, but I think it’s worth looking into.”

“Or death,” Bradley counters. Sydero and I exchange a curious, but bewildered, glance with one another.
			
“Death, Bradley?” I question.
			
“It’s a possibility. I’m just throwing stuff out there.”

	“What do we have and know?” Bradley questions and we list out all the things that could possibly help us out.

Our best lead is running around Bladenboro, a place we don’t know, hoping to catch Chris, who was going through who knows what.
	
	“So, find Chris or find the beast?” Sydero asks.
	
	“Find Chris, we don’t need him running around looking like a madman,” Bradley tells us.
	
	“Where’s his current location now?” I ask. I hear Bradley typing before giving us the location ... the park. We hang up after Bradley promises to look deeper into the legend, as well as try and come up with guesses of what might be befalling Chris. We head towards the park.
	
	There were a few street lights on, but otherwise, it was dark and silent.

	“Shame, drunk Roe is pretty entertaining. I’m going to miss $him,” she chuckles, yanking me to my feet and dragging me towards the woods.
	
	“Speaking of drunk Roe, should I be going in there with you? I feel like I’ll get in the way.”

Despite the new information that Bradley gave us, I still feel like we’re far from any kind of decent lead. Our best lead is running around Bladenboro, a place we don’t know, hoping to catch Chris, who was going through who knows what.
	
	“So, find Chris or find the beast?” Sydero asks.
	
	“Find Chris, we don’t need him running around looking like a madman,” Bradley tells us.
	
	“Where’s his current location now?” I ask. I hear Bradley typing before giving us the location ... the park. We hang up after Bradley promises to look deeper into the legend, as well as try and come up with guesses of what might be befalling Chris. We head towards the park.
	
	There were a few street lights on, but otherwise, it was dark and silent.

	“Where was she last seen?” I ask. Bradley begins typing something before giving us the location ... the park. We head out, driving towards the park that we had visited earlier that day, or yesterday, this whole hunting in the middle of the night thing was still getting me.
	
	There are a few street lights on when we arrive, but otherwise, it was dark and silent. There’s no light breeze or the sound of night insects chirping and singing, everything was completely still.

“Well?” I question.

“There’s a legend around it that might either be true or not, but the locals call it the Bladenboro Beast.” Bradley gets quiet, probably wanting his words to sink in.

“Not very creative if you ask me,” Sydero mumbles, “what else did you learn?”

“Not much. Legend says that the beast is some large creature that feeds on animal hearts. A couple of years ago it was attacking and those that claim to have seen it always claim that it’s massive, walks on all fours, have blue eyes, and sharp fangs.

“Those are some pretty big woods, we might not be able to find him so easily,” Sydero starts, curling up her lips in disgust, “Bladenboro Beast, I hate local cryptids.”
	
“Why?”
	
“I know how to put a werewolf or vampire down, but local cryptids are always a special case. Your only source of information about them is local and you gotta hope there’s enough to go off of.” She grabs her unique blade and expertly tosses it a short distance into the air, admiring it, “luckily, most supernaturals die or at least are injured by silver.”
	
I hear an owl in the distance, jumping into Syd as I tell myself to calm down. Woods and I didn’t have a good track record, and the last thing I wanted to do was go into them at night to find my crazed best friend and some local cryptid.
	
“Chill, Roe, you can’t tell me you’re afraid of an owl.”
	
“Of course not,” I huff.

“You’re kidding? So, a parrot comes, and you just shrivel up?”
			
“Shut up,” I growl, “from a distance, I’m fine. But as soon as they come closer, I freak out.” My stomach churns at the thought of one coming super close, and I wave the thought and conversation away. Thankfully, Syd seems ready to start searching, entering the woods with me right behind her.

“Like, insects in general or just a few?”
			
“In general, really. Butterflies creep me out, I scream at ladybugs, bees make me want to die on the spot. Don’t get me started on wasps and dragonflies.” Sydero snorts as if my fear was actually entertaining, but knowing her it probably was. She begins the walk into the woods, and I begin thinking about all the insects I might run into now.

“What a common fear,” Syd snorts, motioning for me to follow as she walks into the woods.
			
“I’d agree if mine was common. I once accidentally stepped on a black widow’s egg nest when I was a kid,” I’m unable to finish the thought as I shiver, shaking my head at the memories that poke at my brain. My fear wasn’t just, ‘ew, spider,’ I was terrified of the things.

My uncle and I were hiking when I almost stepped on a rattlesnake.” I shiver at the thought, sighing as I push it back out of my mind.
			
“You would be terrified of the one creature I actually adore,” Syd points out, and I give her an incredulous look. Of course. Of course, she would like the one animal I feared most of all. She motions for me to follow her and we begin our trek through the woods.

“Roe, try calling Chris’s phone. Hopefully, it’s not on vibrate, and we can hear it from here.” I nod at the idea and do as she says. The plan works, and his ringtone gives us the general direction to go in. As we go, we can see the light of some of the nearby houses through peeks in the trees, we were coming back up on the outskirts of the woods. On one hand, that meant we were getting out of the woods, on the other, Chris was over here but for what reason?
	
I call his phone for the third time and hear it nearby, we were practically right next to him. Sydero swivels, flashing her light in the direction and it is there where we find Chris. He’s leaning most of his weight on a tree, his eyes almost glowing in the darkness. His gaze is set on a dog inside an enclosed fence. The dog was currently in its doghouse, and I can only tell that he’s staring at us because of the light shining over him. He looks terrified, and I can’t blame him.
	
“Chris?” I call out, but Chris doesn’t react to my voice, still staring at the dog. His breathing is ragged, and I can tell that some of his clothes are ripped. At least I know he wasn’t dying.
	
“Using common sense here,” Sydero begins, slowly walking towards Chris’s rear, “I’d say he’s transforming, but it’s not complete. It might not be complete until he eats a heart.”
	
“And how do we change him back?”
	
“Usually by killing the thing that turned him. Other times by doing some insane ritual, and sometimes there’s no going back.” I give Sydero a long look, even if she was just trying to inform me, I could do without the last one.
	
I approach Chris slowly, hands out in front as if he was some wild animal that needed to be calmed and tamed. The latter of my thought was probably a stretch, but comparing Chris to a wild animal was not.
	
“How is he changing this quick?” I ask Sydero who keeps her distance, “the thing only scratched him yesterday!”
	
“Bradley might’ve been onto something about the death part. Some creatures are able to quickly spread whatever virus they have to enable transformation since the act itself is rare.”
	
“But the beast is still killing,” I argue.	
&lt;&lt;if $oldman&gt;&gt;\
	
	“And it was also shot by that old man, remember?” I close my mouth, now wondering if the beast’s life was coming to an end. My eyes drift back over to Chris whose gaze flickers between Sydero and me.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

The question that I was most worried about concerned Chris, and how to subdue him.

I keep close to Sydero, shining my light on the side that she wasn’t paying much attention to. Looking in the woods for some random girl we’ve never met before, it shouldn’t be that hard, right?
	
Syd stops, looking around with a bored expression, “maybe we should split up, see if we can find her better that way.”
	
[[“Heck no!”]]

&lt;&lt;if $hangover&gt;&gt;\
	We creep closer towards him, angling ourselves so that he couldn’t just run off. I look at Sydero and nod, both of us lunging towards Chris. He shouts, throwing out a fist that instantly connects with my jaw. I shake it off the best I can, which wasn’t good at all. The hangover was still present and, combined with the punch, was scrambling my thoughts. Either he was much stronger than I initally thought he was, or this hangover was making me sensitive – or both.

He was much stronger than he originally was.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
		
“Stop messing around, Roe,” Sydero shouts, barely fast enough to dodge Chris’s attack. Not only was he looking more feral, but he was fighting as if he was some type of cornered prey. One minute he was fighting like a human, the next he was slashing with nails that he didn’t have.

“You’re going to what?” Syd questions, giving me her usual ‘you’re crazy’ look.
			
“I believe Chris is still in there. If I can just calm him down and get close enough, I can get him.”
			
“Oh, this I have to see.” Syd leans up against a nearby tree, patiently waiting to see how this would go.
			
I slowly approach Chris, talking to him in a soft voice and bringing up past memories, hoping that it will move something inside of him. His attention is still on the dog, but when I get into his personal space, he jerks around to stare at me. His pupils were beginning to turn into slits, and I couldn&#39;t help but feel like I was losing him.
			
“Come on, Chris, there’s no way you went full beast on me just yet,” I say, taking another cautious step towards him. I was now directly in front of him.
			
“Chris?” I question. He blinks once, then twice, and then rapid fire. It looks like the haziness in his eyes clear up, and he tilts his head to the side slightly, his mouth parting. Abruptly, he reaches for me and with all of his might, pushes me into a tree that is a few feet away.
			
“And there it goes,” Syd chuckles from her spot, Chris charging towards me.
			
[[Move so he hits the tree.]]
[[Tell Syd to come help me.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="989" name="Move so he hits the tree." tags="" position="3379,4012" size="100,100">I mimic Syd’s laughing, taking a step away from the tree at the right moment so that Chris ends up running into it. I hear the loud thud and shake my head at the pain that would’ve caused any sane person to be in enormous discomfort. Chris rests on the ground, still, and his eyes closed.
					
“Nice, Roe. I can’t wait till he wakes up and questions how he got that knot on his forehead,” Syd smirks, and I glance down to see one beginning to form precisely where she says.
					
“I’ll just blame it on you.”
					
“Despite how funny that is, I won’t claim it. And that’ll probably be enough evidence for him to know it was your fault.” I grumble underneath my breath.

“Let’s get this guy back to the car and then to Bradley,” Syd begins, grabbing him and supporting his left side. I go to the right, and we both quickly retrace our steps back, pausing when we hear growling in the nearby bushes.
	
“Uh, that doesn’t sound like it’s some cute little forest animal who wants to be pet,” I gulp, repositioning Chris’s limp form.
	
“That’s because it’s not,” Sydero hisses in reply, “run.” The two of us take off, constantly repositioning Chris and then having to slow down for the other as we go. We don’t get far when I practically feel something on the back of my neck, and then feel something swipe at my legs. I trip, rolling out of the way as a claw comes down in front of me.
	
My eyes widen as I stare back at the beast, and beast it was. Like all the accounts have said, the creature was large with mangled fur and haunting blue eyes. The entire thing reminded me of a bobcat who was incredibly large and had gotten into it with some barbwire. It rears up, howling as it plans to stomp me into the ground. Just as it does, Sydero flings herself towards it, ramming her shoulder into its side and causing it to fall and skid to the side.
	
“We gotta go,” she tells me, yanking me up to my feet.

He immediately changes his direction and comes after me again. “Syd!”
					
Before Chris can get to me again, he trips and hits the forest floor with a loud thump, hopefully, there were no rocks nearby. Syd stands behind him, putting pressure on one of his pressure points before giving me a look.
				
“Is the little baby okay?” she asks, mimicking the voice a concerned mother would make.
					
“Shut up, but I’m fine, thanks for asking.”

The entire thing reminded me of a bobcat who was incredibly large and had gotten into it with some barbwire. It rears up, howling as it plans to stomp me into the ground. Just as it does, Sydero flings herself towards it, ramming her shoulder into its side and causing it to fall and skid to the side.
	
“We gotta go,” she tells me, yanking me up to my feet.

It was still too dark outside for me to be able to see anything clearly, and so I rely mostly on touch. I stick near trees, running my hands lightly over the grass and dirt. I finally feel something harsh, long, and with a circular base, and pick it up. Yep, it was a stick alright. Albeit, not the thickest or strongest branch, but it was going to have to be enough for now.
				
I find Chris and Sydero still grappling. I’m reminded of the two sparring, Chris never coming close to being able to land a hit on Syd. Syd would continuously point out that Chris was better long distance, calling him a goner in hand to hand combat. But here he was, holding his own. It was because of the foreign blood shooting through his veins, but visually it was still Chris.
					
I shake the thought away, creeping closer. This stick wasn’t thick enough to get multiple hits in. I would have to do one good one and hope it was enough. He comes closer, and I take the hit, hitting the back of his head. The stick breaks immediately on contact, and Chris turns to me, as if asking me if I seriously had the audacity to do such a thing.
					
Before Chris can retaliate, Sydero knocks him out, shaking out her fist as he goes down.
					
“A stick? Seriously?”
					
“It bought you time, didn’t it?” I ask back, rolling my eyes at her question.

“Let’s get this guy back to the car and then to Bradley,” Syd begins, grabbing him and supporting his left side. I go to the right, and we both quickly retrace our steps back, pausing when we hear growling in the nearby bushes.
	
“Uh, that doesn’t sound like it’s some cute little forest animal who wants to be pet,” I gulp, repositioning Chris’s limp form.
	
“That’s because it’s not,” Sydero hisses in reply, “run.” The two of us take off, constantly repositioning Chris and then having to slow down for the other as we go. We don’t get far when I practically feel something on the back of my neck, and then feel something swipe at my legs. I trip, rolling out of the way as a claw comes down in front of me.

I pull my shirt off and creep up on Chris, he lunges back, dodging Sydero’s throw, and that’s when I make my move.
					
I throw my shirt over Chris’s head, and the suddenness causes him to panic. Before he can topple onto me, Sydero swoops in and takes his legs out from underneath of him, causing him to fall to the side. Before he can do any more damage to himself, or us, Sydero knocks him out.

She nods her head and goes to Chris’s side, quickly moving forward again. I place my attention on the beast who was just now shaking off Sydero’s previous ram. Its eyes land on me and alight with unrestrained rage.

One arm keeps Chris secure while the other fiddles with my phone, lighting my way. Behind me, I hear the sound of shots being fired and a mix between a roar and a whimper.
			
I find my way through the woods, happy when I can see the brightness of a nearby light post. I spot the car and make a dash towards it.
			
“Ugh,” I hear Chris moan, oh great, he was beginning to wake up.

&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
I grab my gun and check the cartridge and then take it off of safety, taking multiple breaths as I get ready. It does the same, its gaze is drawn to the gun. It sounds like it’s grumbling as it begins to circle me. Once its eyes meet mine, it charges.
					
I fire two rounds into it, wanting to see how it would react to that. The hit doesn’t do anything though, it just keeps coming, as if I hadn’t even shot at it.
					
Good thing I just needed to buy some time, not actually kill the creature. Also, this was proof that silver bullets weren’t doing anything. It gets too close for comfort, and I roll to the side, cursing to myself when I remember that I was outside amongst sticks and rocks and other such things.
					
“Roe!” I hear Sydero shout and after firing two more shots, aimed at its face, take off.

	“Don’t have to tell me twice, let’s go!” I shout, quickly hopping into the car and then speeding away. I forget that we’re still in a residential area and I book it, probably going sixty. Whatever gets us out of there faster.

	We arrive at the motel about ten minutes after leaving the park. The girl was just now waking up from being knocked out, and by the way she was fighting the restraints Syd put on her, we were probably going to have to knock her out again.

	“Who knew teens could be so rowdy,” Syd growls, dragging her out of the car, but then letting her go after almost kicking her in the gut. I flinch at the sound of her body hitting the ground, though it seems she felt nothing. She thrashes and fights her restraints.

	I grab her legs while Syd grabs her shoulders, “she is a lot feistier now, huh?” I question, grimacing as she attempts to wrestle her legs back, but I refuse her this luxury.

I bring out my blade, twirling it around and then regretting it a second later, I wasn’t quite there yet. Putting my attention back on the beast, it charges without any consideration for the weapon now in my grasp. The reach of the blade wasn’t tremendous, it was about the same length, if not just a tad bit shorter as a short sword.
					
The beast is upon me, swiping its paw towards me and I swing my blade. My blade skids across its paw, creating a deep gash that the creature doesn’t appreciate. It whimpers, its eyes blazing with new hatred for me.
					
It charges again, this time barreling towards me, shoulder first. I time my jump, jumping out of the way and sliding my blade down its flank as I go. It turns around, and I narrowly avoid its claws.

“I think I finally realized what’s going on. What’s going on with Chris, BB, and everything really.”

“I think BB is – well, parenting Chris. I was able to get on the dark web and look deeper. Which is saying a lot cos there was still literally nothing even on the dark web. Anyway, I found that the beast before this one was said to have yellow eyes and a white mark on its chest, this one obviously not fitting that description. BB seems to pop up, hunt, someone goes missing, and then it disappears again. What if the people it ends up changing, it ends up taking a mothering role over them? Teaching them to survive and what not?”
			
“So, BB just wants to be a parent, I still don’t see why it decides to go on a pet killing spree and then turn some random person,” Sydero points out, “plus, we’ve only run into one of these things, what happened to the one with yellow eyes?”
			
“I was wondering the exact same thing,” Bradley continues, “and this is more of a hypothesis than a fact, but what if it’s killing to feed whoever it ends up transforming? Remember my death idea, what if it goes after someone when it knows its life is coming to an end, and the last thing it does is teach and parent this person? Pets are easy prey, so it goes after them to make sure the transforming person has food.”

I bite the side of my cheek, looking back towards the woods where the beast is still probably at.
			
“Hold up, Syd, I think we should go and handle the beast. We have a perfect window.” She opens her door and turns to me.
			
“Chris is in the back seat, dying, and you want to go ‘handle’ the beast. We need to secure him.”
			
“It’s stupid to just let the beast run off, especially when we’re this close.”
			
“When did I start caring more about Chris’s life than you?” she questions, cocking her head to the side in interest.
			
“This is for Chris,” I say, “that creature, whether through death or something else, holds the answer to getting Chris back. Are you seriously saying we should just leave?”
			
“No, what I’m saying is that it’s stupid to handle two crazies at the same time. We make sure that crazy is secure, and then focus on that one.” I begin to argue her point further when a loud roar pierces our ears. We both glance in the direction to see the beast charging out of the woods and towards us.
			
“Doesn’t seem to matter anymore,” Sydero growls when suddenly Chris hops onto her back, bringing her to the ground.
			
“Who do I go for?” I question aloud, actually wanting an answer from Syd, but I receive nothing but the roar from the beast, and grunts from Sydero as she tries to grab Chris. Guess I was making this decision.

	“Winfrey,” the girl squeaks. We each freeze, gazing over at her as she readjusts herself in the blanket. “My name is Winfrey.”

	“How long have you been sane?” Syd asks with an accusatory tone, earning a sharp tap across the head from Bradley.

	“Long enough to hear you guys call me girl numerous of times. I ... I know what you guys did for me in the woods too, you helped me but –” she growls, suddenly she clenches her head, moaning in agony. “What’s happening to me?” I look at the other two, wondering if any of them were going to tell her.

	Before any of us can tell her, what was going on with her, she screams again, pointing to the door and backing away, “it’s coming. It’s mad at you, it’s mad that you keep trying to keep me from it.” Her eyes go wide, and she clutches her head, when she looks back at us, I don’t see Winfrey anymore, I see whatever I fought back in the woods.

		I join Sydero by the window, looking across the street at BB. I swear BB’s staring right back at us, its blue eyes raging with fury at what we stole from it. Though, it took Chris from us first, so I lack any sympathy.
		
		“Exactly what do you have planned, Bradley?” I question, turning to him. His eyes are on Chris who is now twitching in his spot, fighting against the binds that hold him.
		
		“It will have me,” he cries, tears running down his eyes as he struggles, “you must let me go. Let me go to it!”
		
		“If I didn’t know better, I’d say we&#39;d already lost Chris,” Syd remarks, grabbing her gun and checking it. Chris’s eyes widen, and he lets out a low roar, thrashing even more.
		
		“This does prove our point about BB being a parent figure,” Bradley tells us, “obviously Chris is feeling some kind of connection to it.”
		
		“Bradley, focus. What’s the plan here?” I question, tearing my eyes from Chris’s figure and back to BB, noticing that it’s prowling the outskirts of the parking lot.
		
		“Syd, you need to use a –” Bradley’s eyes go from me to her, “an empathy spell. BB’s top motivation obviously has to do with Chris so we might be able to figure out how to reverse whatever it is by figuring out what BB is trying to stop us from doing. $name, you need to help her with subduing BB.”
		
		“What’s the plan then?” Syd asks me, opening the door and facing off against BB, “it’s already injured, we just need to do enough to put it down, but not kill it, not until I can figure out what I need.”

		Sydero and I both approach the window, looking across the street and, sure enough, seeing BB standing there. I swear BB’s staring right back at us, its blue eyes raging with fury at what we stole from it.
		
		“Exactly what do you have planned, Bradley?” I question, turning to him. His eyes are on Winfrey who is now twitching in her spot, fighting against the binds that hold her.
		
		“It will have me,” she cries, tears running down her eyes as she struggles, “you must let me go. Let me go to it!” I’m about to turn back to the others when she suddenly screeches, “no. Don’t let it get me.” She cries, hard enough for snot to seep out of her nose.
	
		“So, before this gets anymore disgusting than it already is, plan?” Syd questions, grabbing her gun and checking it. Winfrey’s eyes widen, and she lets out a low roar, thrashing even more.
		
		“This does prove our point about BB being a parent figure,” Bradley tells us, “obviously Winfrey is feeling some kind of connection to it.”

I keep her lack of quarreling to myself, for now.

&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	We run through the woods, attempting to catch sight of Chris or the beast. We fail to see them, but we hear them easily. The whimpers of the creature and what I can only believe is Chris’s labored breathing.
	
	“Stop, slow down,” Sydero suddenly directs, putting her hand out in front of me and getting down. The whimpering of the beast is gone, but we both hear something else, something that we don’t exactly know. And not only that, but a horrible smell intrudes our noses, causing both of us to want to gag. Crouched, we continue forward until we get a better view of what’s going on. A sizeable makeshift nest has been built out of rocks, twigs, and leaves. 
	
	In the middle sits the bodies of all the dead animals that we had heard about. The decomposing bodies are surrounded by flying insects, enjoying the buffet.
	
	“Well, I think we found the animals,” Sydero whispers harshly, looking around for something else. I tug her sleeve and point to the side where the beast rests. It lays on its side, whimpering quietly as it licks a collection of wounds. Chris is sitting off to the side, curled up in a fetal position. He gasps and kicks, and upon further investigation, I can hear him struggling to grasp his situation.
	
	“Help me,” I hear him cry out weakly, “$name.” I barely make out him saying my name, but it’s enough to make me move closer. Sydero grabs my arm, raising a brow at my involuntary action.
	
	“So, we stick with the plan we made back there?” I question, and she nods decisively, creeping away from me and closer towards the beast. The plan called for me to subdue Chris while Sydero did a ritual to look into BB’s motivations. Bradley was hoping that an empathy spell would tell us what we were searching for, therefore learning how to turn Chris back. I don’t know how long this ritual would take Sydero, but I was to make sure Chris didn’t do anything to jeopardize us turning him back. This mostly meant eating any of the spoiled hearts sitting not too far off.
	
	I stay where I am when Sydero flies out of the bushes, past the barricade that BB had set up, and towards BB’s hulking frame. BB stands up to roar, leaving its midsection open for Sydero’s blade to easily cut the fur and flesh that rests there. BB looks to Chris, and I suppose in cryptid language, orders him to do something, because the next thing I know, Chris is rushing toward the pile of putrid hearts.
	
	“Oh no you don’t,” I shout, dashing for Chris. As soon as I’m near him, he turns and kicks me straight in the gut. I bend over, a lack of breath making it to my lungs as my body tries to figure out what had just happened. Before I can overthink it, Chris picks up a stick and swings it at my head.
	
	I jump back, and he approaches.

It heads for Sydero, and so I pick up a large rock, chucking it straight at its head.
					
Its head whips towards me, its path changing but then it comes to a complete halt, its attention going back to Sydero and Chris. The beast does a long call before turning and cantering back into the woods, Chris following behind it as it goes. The two disappearing and neither Sydero nor I follow.

“Syd, wanna handle the beast?” I ask.
					
“No, I want to get out of here,” she growls but sprints towards the beast, grabbing her blade. She skids, swinging the blade right as the creature gets into striking distance. She could handle herself, I needed to handle Chris. He stalks around me, his posture twisted to mirror that of the beast. I pause at that. I had just fought him a few minutes ago, and this wasn’t his fighting style.
			
Chris swipes at me, getting two good hits that send me to the ground. The beast does a long call before turning and cantering back into the woods, Chris following behind it as it goes. The two disappearing and neither Sydero nor I follow.

“And we lost both of them, again,” Sydero mutters, helping me to my feet. She lightly hits me upside the head, “have I told you how much I hate your plans? Because I do, I really do.” It wasn&#39;t like I expected Chris to run off after the beast as if he was some obedient little pup, following behind his master.
			
Before I’m able to say anything, my phone rings and I look to see that it’s Bradley.
			
“You call me to tell me how much you hate my plans too?” I give Sydero a look, and she matches it with one of her own.
			
“Um no, should I ... whatever, I called because I think I finally realized what’s going on. What’s going on with Chris, BB, and everything, really.”
			
“Hold up, hold up,” Sydero starts, “BB?”
			
“Yea, Bladenboro Beast, BB.”
			
“Very, creative Bradley, but I think I know exactly what’s going on here,” I begin to tell him, “the beast is ...”

	“I realized it when Chris attacked me the second time, his posture mirrored that of ... BB. And then it got me thinking about how we found the beast and Chris in the same area, how Chris looked like he was hunting that dog and the beast was nearby. The beast, for whatever reason, is parenting Chris, teaching him how to survive.”
				
	“Bradley?” Sydero questions, stroking her chin as she thinks about my words, but seems to also want a second opinion.
				
	“I’ve come to the same conclusion, well not because of Chris’s mannerisms, but due to the pattern. I was able to get on the dark web and look deeper. Which is saying a lot because there was still literally nothing on even the dark web. Anyway, I found that the beast before this one was said to have yellow eyes and a white mark on its chest, this one obviously not fitting that description. BB seems to pop up, hunt, someone goes missing, and then it disappears again.”
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“... yea, I don’t know.”
			
	“I’m surrounded by idiots,” Sydero mumbles, “Bradley?”
				
	“I think BB is – well, parenting Chris. I was able to get on the dark web and look deeper. Which is saying a lot cos there was still literally nothing even on the dark web. Anyway, I found that the beast before this one was said to have yellow eyes and a white mark on its chest, this one obviously not fitting that description. BB seems to pop up, hunt, someone goes missing, and then it disappears again. What if the people it ends up changing, it ends up taking a mothering role over them? Teaching them to survive and what not?”
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“So, BB just wants to be a parent, I still don’t see why it decides to go on a pet killing spree and then turn some random person. Plus, we’ve only run into one of these things, what happened to the one with yellow eyes?”
				
“I was wondering the exact same thing,” Bradley continues, “and this is more of a hypothesis than a fact, but what if it’s killing to feed whoever it ends up transforming? Remember my death idea, what if it goes after someone when it knows its life is coming to an end, and the last thing it does is teach and parent this person? Pets are easy prey, so it goes after them to make sure the, transforming person has food.”

Bradley looks at me in worry while Sydero just looks amused, she was definitely going to bring me on her bar trips more often, “I mean, I don’t think I’m sane enough for this.”

“I second that,” Bradley says, but Syd waves his worries away.

“I don’t see why we need to go investigate this in the first place,” she points out, “I see no relation to the supernatural we’re hunting.”

“Oh, I forgot that I haven’t told you guys what I also found. I think I know what you’ve been after this entire time.”

“Well?” I question.

“There’s a legend around it that might either be true or not, but the locals call it the Bladenboro Beast.” Bradley gets quiet, probably wanting his words to sink in.

“Not very creative if you ask me,” Sydero mumbles, “what else did you learn?”

“Not much. Legend says that the beast is some large creature that feeds on animal hearts. A couple of years ago it was attacking and those that claim to have seen it always claim that it’s massive, walks on all fours, have blue eyes, and sharp fangs. Everyone thought that they killed it when the locals killed a cougar and the killing stopped, but no one was one-hundred percent sure.”

[[“So, why did the killings stop?”]]
[[“So, is it a werecat or not?”]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1011" name="BB4" tags="" position="3159,3801" size="100,100">We march to the outskirts of the familiar woods, stopping there.

“Those are some pretty big woods, we might not be able to find her so easily,” Sydero starts, curling up her lips in disgust, “Bladenboro Beast, I hate local cryptids.”

“Why?”

“I know how to put a werewolf or vampire down, but local cryptids are always a special case. Your only source of information about them is local and you gotta hope there’s enough to go off of.” She grabs her unique blade and expertly tosses it a short distance into the air, admiring it, “luckily most supernaturals die or at least are injured by silver.”

I hear an owl in the distance, jumping into Syd as I tell myself to calm down. Woods and I didn’t have a good track record, and the last thing I wanted to do was go into them at night to find my crazed best friend and some local cryptid.

“Chill, Roe, you can’t tell me you’re afraid of an owl.”

“Of course not,” I huff.

“You sure?”

The first rule to a horror movie, never split up, come on Syd, you’re better than this,” I scold her, and she holds her hand up in surrender.
			
“I’m just trying to find this chick faster. We’re never going to find her this way.”
			
“I’d rather not find her at all than to find her and be by myself when I do.” With the matter put to rest, we continue on. We get closer to the outskirts of the nearby houses, seeing some of their backyard lights from where we were. I’m about to travel closer when we both hear someone snap a branch, the sound of a dog whimpering follows behind that.

I get down, making my way towards the sound when I see the girl. It was the pre-teen from earlier, the one that had her dog taken away from her.

She’s leaning most of her weight on a tree, her blue eyes almost glowing in the darkness. Due to my phone light still being on, I also realize that she’s practically naked, only a bra and underwear hiding her extremities. Her gaze is set on a dog inside an enclosed fence. The dog was currently in its house, and I can only tell that he’s staring at us because of the light shining over him. He looks petrified, and I can’t blame him.

“Um, girl?” I call out, never getting her name, but needing to catch her attention. She doesn’t respond to my voice, still staring at the dog, her breathing ragged.

“Using common sense here,” Sydero begins, slowly walking towards the girl’s rear, “I’d say she’s transforming, but it’s not complete. It might not be complete until she eats a heart.”
			
“And how do we change her back?”

“Usually by killing the thing that turned her. Other times by doing some insane ritual, and sometimes there’s no going back.” I give Sydero a long look, even if she was just trying to inform me, I could do without the last one.

I approach the girl slowly, hands out in front as if she was some wild animal that needed to be calmed and tamed. The latter of my thought was probably a stretch but comparing her to a wild animal was not.

“How is she changing this quick?” I ask Sydero who keeps her distance, “the thing only scratched her yesterday afternoon!”

“Bradley might’ve been onto something about the death part. Some creatures are able to quickly spread whatever virus they have to enable transformation since the act itself is rare.”

“But the beast is still killing,” I argue.
&lt;&lt;if $oldman&gt;&gt;\

	“And it was also shot by that old man, remember?” I close my mouth, now wondering if the beast’s life was coming to an end. My eyes drift back over to the preteen whose gaze now flickers between Sydero and me.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

The question that I was most worried about concerned the girl, and how to subdue her.
		
“Alright, let&#39;s move in, both of us,” I tell her, and she nods, moving in a step more.

“Shouldn’t be too hard, right?” Syd asks, “she’s just a little girl.”
					
&lt;&lt;if $hangover&gt;&gt;\
	We creep closer towards her, angling ourselves so that she couldn’t just run off. I look at Sydero and nod, both of us lunging towards the girl. She lets out a feral cry and throws punches left and right at me, out of the fifteen she throws, one actually connects. It sends me reeling and, combined with my still present hangover, triples the pain. Either she was much stronger than I initially thought, or this hangover was making me sensitive – or both.

&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“Stop messing around Roe,” Sydero shouts, barely fast enough to dodge the girl’s attack. Not only was she looking feral, but she was fighting as if she was some type of cornered prey. One minute she was fighting like a human, the next she was slashing with her nails.

&lt;&lt;if $SRomance &gt;= 3&gt;&gt;\
	“I don’t yell, Roe,” she smirks and turns back to me, her eyes glancing up and down my body, “that’s something I do to others.” My mouth flattens into a thin line as she chuckles, her and her light disappearing.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“I don’t yell, Roe, it’s not my style,” she tells me and then shakes her phone, “I’ll just call you. Like a normal person.” I roll my eyes, I have definitely heard her yell before, but whatever floats her sinking boat I suppose.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
			
I continue on, on my own now, realizing that the absence of Sydero’s light was making it much harder to see my surroundings. I see the hint of light in the distance, peaking through the trees and I follow it immediately. The outline of houses appears, and I realize that the light that I allowed to guide me, were basic backyard lights. Either way, it was a much-needed source, and I stick close to the outskirts of the woods as I continue looking.

I hear a branch snap, thinking it to be Sydero, when I then hear a dog whimpering. Unless Sydero was forcing some poor dog into listening to how emotionless she was, I doubt it was her.

I get down, making my way towards the sound when I see the girl. It was the pre-teen from earlier, the one that had her dog taken away from her.

&lt;&lt;if $hangover&gt;&gt;\
	I creep closer towards her, speaking in a low voice to not scare her off. I was really going after this wild animal angle. Once I’m close enough, I lunge towards the girl.

It sends me reeling, and combined with my still present hangover, triples the pain.

	I creep closer towards her, speaking in a low voice to not scare her off. I was really going after this wild animal angle. Once I’m close enough, I lunge towards the girl. She lets out a feral cry and throws punches left and right at me, out of the fifteen she throws, one actually connects. It sends me reeling, my jaw aching as the pain slowly begins to fade.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

Great, not only was she feral but she was fighting as if she was some kind of cornered prey. I move my jaw around and glare at the woman, trying to figure out what to do.

[[Tackle her.]]

[[Use my shirt to cover her face.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1014" name="Tackle her." tags="" position="3921,4007" size="100,100">I didn’t really have any good ideas, none of them were bound to work anyway. The best plan I could think of that could actually bring her down, was tackling her. And that’s precisely what I do. I leap forward, grabbing the girl around the waist and letting gravity do the rest. Underneath me, she fights and struggles to get up, but I’m sitting on her back, trying to keep her down with all of my weight.

&lt;&lt;if $split&gt;&gt;\
	I suddenly hear a loud whimper, followed by a furious roar in the distance. I do believe Sydero found the beast. I was surprised that it was so close. Were it and the girl hunting the same thing?

	I scoop the preteen into my arms, taking off towards the car. I’m sure Sydero could handle the beast, and if she couldn’t then she was smart enough to know where to run.

	I find my way through the woods, happy when I can see the brightness of a nearby light post. I spot the car and make a dash towards it.

	“Ugh,” I hear the young woman moan, oh great, she was beginning to wake up.
	
	[[Knock her back out.-&gt;BBKO]]
	[[Keep running.]]
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“So, what do we do with her?” I ask Syd, staring down at her limp form.

	“Normally, I’d say we should bring her to the motel, so we can figure out how to change her back. But I don’t think I want to risk getting caught by police.”

	“Do we have any other choice?” I ask next, personally not being able to think of anything else.

	“I don’t think we do, especially since we don’t know how to change her back yet.” Sydero sighs scooping the young girl into her arms. I lead the way out of the woods, pausing when I hear growling in the nearby bushes.

	“Uh, that doesn’t sound like it’s some cute little forest animal who wants to be pet,” I gulp.

	“That’s because it’s not,” Sydero hisses in reply, “run.” The two of us take off, Sydero slowing down regularly due to having to readjust the preteen in her arms. I take up the rear to ensure their safety when I practically feel something on the back of my neck, and then feel something swipe at my legs. I trip, rolling out of the way as a claw comes down in front of me.

	My eyes widen as I stare back at the beast, and beast it was. Like all the accounts have said, the creature was large with mangled fur and haunting blue eyes. The entire thing reminded me of a bobcat who was incredibly large and had gotten into it with some barbwire. It rears up, howling as it plans to stomp me into the ground. Just as it does, Sydero flings herself towards it, ramming her shoulder into its side and causing it to fall and skid to the side.

	“We gotta go,” she tells me, yanking me up to my feet.

It was still too dark outside for me to be able to see anything clearly, and so I rely mostly on touch. I stick near trees, running my hands lightly over the grass and dirt. I finally feel something harsh, long, and with a circular base, and pick it up. Yep, it was a stick alright. Albeit, not the thickest or strongest branch, but it was going to have to be enough for now.

&lt;&lt;if $split&gt;&gt;\
	I shake the thought away, creeping closer. This stick wasn’t thick enough to get multiple hits in. I would have to do one good one and hope it was enough. She comes closer, and I take the hit, hitting the back of her head. The stick breaks immediately on contact, and the girl goes down without a problem.
	
	I go towards her limp body when I hear a loud whimper, followed by a furious roar in the distance. I do believe Sydero found the beast. I was surprised that it was so close. Were it and the girl hunting the same thing?

&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	I find the girl and Sydero still grappling. Sydero clearly had the upper hand, but the girl was fast enough to avoid Sydero’s punches and therefore was making Sydero work for this win. I can see her growing agitated, probably since she had to hold back with most of her blows.	
	Sydero huffs, backing away from the body, “A stick? Seriously?”

	“It did the trick, didn’t it?” I ask back, rolling my eyes at her question.

	“So, what do we do with her?” I ask Syd, staring down at her limp form.

	Public indecency wasn’t really a thing when you were trying to save yourself and someone else’s life. Or maybe it was, but it didn’t really concern me at four o’clock in the morning. I pull my shirt off dodging the girl’s wild throws until I find the perfect opportunity.

	I throw my shirt over her head, and the suddenness causes her to panic. Before she can topple onto me, I slide out of the way and then trip her.

Its eyes land on me and alight with unrestrained rage.

“Is there a reason why she has no clothes on?” he questions, getting up and grabbing a blanket, resting it over top of her. Her eyes bulge at the material, and she hisses at Bradley.

“We found her like that. Now, what do you have for us, Bradley?” Syd asks once she gets to his side.

“I think I finally realized what’s going on. What’s going on with her, BB, and everything, really.”

“Hold up, hold up,” Sydero interrupts, her face scrunching up in confusion, “BB?”

“Yea, Bladenboro Beast, BB, try to keep up here.”

&lt;&lt;if $serious &gt;= 50&gt;&gt;\
	“Can we get back to the subject, please?” I groan, rolling my eyes and motioning for him to continue.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“Very creative, Bradley,” I chuckle, motioning for him to continue.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“I think BB is – well, parenting this girl. I was able to get on the dark web and look deeper. Which is saying a lot cos there was still literally nothing on even the dark web. Anyway, I found that the beast before this one was said to have yellow eyes and a white mark on its chest, this one obviously not fitting that description. BB seems to pop up, hunt, someone goes missing, and then it disappears again. What if the people it ends up changing, it ends up taking a mothering role over them? Teaching them to survive and what not?”

“So, BB just wants to be a parent, I still don’t see why it decides to go on a pet killing spree and then turn some random person,” Sydero points out, “plus, we’ve only run into one of these things, what happened to the one with yellow eyes?”

“I was wondering the exact same thing,” Bradley continues, “and this is more of a hypothesis than a fact, but what if it’s killing to feed whoever it ends up transforming? Remember my death idea, what if it goes after someone when it knows its life is coming to an end, and the last thing it does is teach and parent this person? Pets are easy prey, so it goes after them to make sure the transforming person has food.”

	“Honestly, I say we wing this. When have plans ever worked out like we hoped?” I question, much to Sydero’s pleasure. She smiles and nods, the two of us closing the motel door as we stare out at BB. BB sniffs the air, grunting in anger as it comes closer.

	“I really don’t think BB likes us,” I point out, looking out at our surroundings. There were a few parked cars, some random potted plants, and one lamp post. Seeing that I wasn’t about to use the cars as cover, out of fear of messing up my own, I was left with hardly anything else.

	“Yea? Well, I can’t say I much like it either,” Sydero snorts, holstering her gun and grabbing her blade, “no using guns, it’ll attract too much attention.” Well, there goes any idea of staying at a distance. I mirror her, grabbing my blade as BB charges towards us. Though the sun was barely beginning to light up the sky, it produced enough light for me to see BB and its enormity. I can feel the ground tremble slightly as BB gets closer, enraged at our actions.

“I don’t know if you’re in there, Chris ... but I could really use my best friend right now. I know that you’re just ... confused and you don’t know what’s going on. But that’s what we’re here for. All of us out here, we’re trying to get you out, but we can’t do that without your help. We need to know how to subdue BB, how to turn you back.”

He blinks his eyes, staring at me with an expressionless face. He gazes towards an impatient Sydero and a hopeful Bradley, looking back towards me.

“$name?” he asks quietly, just loud enough for me to hear him.
				
&lt;&lt;if $CRomance &gt;= 3&gt;&gt;\
	“Yea, it’s me, Chris,” I smile, my eyes widening when he raises his hand and rests it on my cheek. He slowly trails it down my face, cupping my cheek.

	“Okay, Beauty, you got through to your Beast, now can we go kill -” Sydero starts.

	“Gaston?!” Bradley shouts, earning a look from all of us, he quiets back down. But, as if on cue, BB roars loudly.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“Yea it’s me, Chris,” I smile, happy to finally get through to him.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
				
I help Chris to his feet as he mumbles something under his breath.

“I know how to calm it down. When I give you the signal then come out and subdue it.” He clenches his head, “and do it quickly, I can’t fight this much longer.” We agree and send Chris out the door, waiting for his signal. He slowly approaches BB who calms down tremendously upon seeing him.

“I’m here,” I hear him say, detecting a bit of happiness in his tone. I seem to not be the only one who hears it, Syd gazing over at me and raising a brow. I had faith in him.

He squats down, and BB sniffs him over, bringing him closer to them. If it weren’t such a weird picture, then it would almost be cute. As I stare at the two, I see Chris motion for us to come.

“You take the left,” Syd says, slipping out the room first with me right behind her. She nods and we both dash forward, blades at the ready as we rush towards BB’s unaware figure. When BB finally notices us, it’s too late.

Sydero rams into BB’s side and I grab Chris, yanking him backward across the concrete. It cries as Sydero slams her pistol down on its head constantly, its eyes on Chris’s figure as the light begins to fade out.

“No!” he suddenly cries and lurches forward.

“Keep him back,” Sydero orders, giving BB one last knock upside the head before murmuring some words. I tighten my arms around Chris as he struggles pathetically against me.

“You’re hurting it!” Chris cries, turning to push me but I don’t budge.

“Alright, this is how this is going to go. We’re going to let you go back to BB.” I suppose he still has an ounce of humanity inside of him, seeing the distrust in his eyes.

“We’re doing what?” Sydero asks, bewildered brow raised as she looks to Bradley who is the same amount of confused.

“You heard me. If Chris wants to go so bad, then I say we let him go. I’m tired of fighting for someone who doesn’t want to fight for himself.” The real Chris would take this as a challenge, or at least take offense to it. But this one just seems joyful, which I suppose is still a good thing. The real Chris would’ve easily known that I was lying.

“Get out of my face,” I sigh, releasing him. He immediately rushes to the door, checking to see if Bradley or Sydero would follow. They don’t move, staring at him as he practically sprints to BB.

I stand in the doorway watching them when Sydero comes by my side, watching them as well. BB was angled so that most of its back was pointed towards us. And luckily, its hulking figure blocked Chris’s view.

&lt;&lt;if $athleticism &gt;= 10&gt;&gt;\
	“Plant your dagger somewhere and get Chris out of there, I’ll do the rest before the damn thing bleeds out,” Sydero directs, handing me my blade.

I do exactly as she says once there, plunging my blade into BB’s neck and then grabbing Chris.
					
	I hear BB roar behind me but turn just in time to see Sydero ram into BB’s side. It cries as Sydero slams her pistol down on its head constantly, its eyes on Chris’s figure as the light begins to fade out.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“Let me take the lead, I’ll handle BB, just get Chris out of there,” Sydero directs. I nod, giving her more room. She takes off in a blindingly fast sprint, and once upon BB, plunges her dagger into its neck. I do exactly as she says once I make it to Chris, grabbing him and putting distance between us and the beast.

	“Keep him back,” Sydero orders, giving BB one last knock upside the head before murmuring some words. I shoot towards Chris, colliding with him and bringing him to the ground.

	“Get off me!” Chris yells, attempting to push me off of him, but failing. His cries don’t even remind me of someone who’s lost someone in front of him, they sound different, as if something had taken him over and was using his voice to voice its own thoughts.

	[[Calm him down.]]
	[[Knock him out.-&gt;BBKO2]]
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“Syd!” I bark, getting an idea, “throw your knife at BB.”
						
	She nods and does as I ask, throwing her blade which lands in BB’s cheek. It howls in pain, desperately clawing at the blade to remove it. Sydero picks up her pace, ramming into BB and bringing her pistol down onto its head multiple times. Its cries fade out but not before Winfrey’s join in. I jerk my head toward the doorway of the motel, seeing Winfrey stand there, and then sprinting towards us.

	“Keep her back,” Sydero orders, giving BB one last knock upside the head before murmuring some words. I shoot towards Winfrey, colliding with her and bringing her to the ground.

	&lt;&lt;elseif $hairlength is &quot;short&quot;&gt;&gt;\
		“Get off me!” Winfrey yells, attempting to push me off of her. She reaches up in an attempt to grab something, lucky for me there’s not much hair to grab.
	&lt;&lt;elseif $hairlength is &quot;medium&quot;&gt;&gt;\
		“Get off me!” Winfrey yells, attempting to push me off of her. She reaches up in an attempt to grab something. Her fingers trails across my hair but before can grab it, I yank my head back, out of reach.
	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
		“Get off me!” Winfrey yells, attempting to push me off of her. She reaches up in an attempt to grab something, clutching onto my hair. She yanks my head down and I yelp as I involuntarily follow her hand, fighting with her to release my hair.
							
		“The hell, Roe? Stop playing games,” Syd growls.
							
		“Shut up, Syd! What kind of game is this?” I yell back, finally unlatching her hands from my hair.
	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
I wrap my arms around him and hug him tightly, burrowing my face in the crook of his neck as he continues to cry out.

“I’m sorry,” I tell him, hearing BB’s whimpering nearby, but I had a feeling that BB wasn’t concerned with its own welfare, but another’s. I feel arms wrap around me and at first, I believe Chris was going to try something else. I only calm down when he turns in his spot, pressing his face into my chest as BB’s moans fade out.

“Roe, hold Chris down, I’ll be right back.” Sydero dashes inside, sending Bradley out to me with a bowl in his hands. He freezes when he sees Chris’s face, eyes red from crying so much. His eyes then go to BB’s body, its breathing highly labored as it takes its last breaths. I’m aware of what those blue eyes are focused on. Not on Chris, but me. Its eyes stare straight at me, perhaps wanting me to look at where my choices have led.

“It’s for Chris,” I hear Bradley murmur, grabbing his own knife and cutting into BB’s side, blood pours out, and he catches some of it in the bowl, approaching me.

He shivers slightly but steels himself, “I need some blood from Chris next.” I nod, watching as he gets the blood from the infected wound that BB had given him. He sets the bowl down and Sydero comes back out, in her hands is the illuminating blue liquid that I had seen in her bag before. She pours half of the small bottle into the bowl and then mixes it with a spoon.

“He has to drink this.” She hands the bowl to me, “quick, before BB is dead.” Bradley helps lift his head up, and I force the contents in the bowl into his mouth, covering his mouth with my hand, forcing him to swallow. Chris’s body begins to convulse quickly when suddenly he stops, he is entirely still. I reach forward, mostly to see if he’s still alive, when he suddenly rolls over onto his stomach, vomiting onto the pavement.

“You back with us, Chris?” I inquire.

He breathes harshly, spitting before looking up at me, “what the hell happened?”

I resituate myself and lean all of my weight onto Chris, somehow managing to slam him to the ground and then sit on him. His growls go from human to animalistic, clawing at the ground as he reaches his hand out towards BB. 

BB’s eyes slowly close, and its moans slowly fade out.

“Roe, hold Chris down, I’ll be right back.” Sydero dashes inside, sending Bradley out to me with a bowl in his hands. He freezes when he sees Chris’s face, eyes red from crying so much.

I tighten my grip as much as I can, keeping him in place as Sydero does whatever she needs to do. In a handful of seconds, she removes her hand and nods at me, bringing her pistol down over BB’s head for the final time.

	I round the corner of my car, sitting beside Chris as he gulps down the water in his grasp. The park rests before us, not yet lively but filled with morning joggers and dog walkers. The dogs yip at their owners, looking a lot freer than they did yesterday. The area is in peace, and the only threat to that peace is our two companion&#39;s bickering off to the side, still leaning on shovels that were borrowed from some random person’s shed.
	
	“How are you feeling?” I ask, looking over at Chris. He glances down at the water in his hands.
	
	“I don’t remember anything. The last thing I recall is us coming here to talk to some of the folks about the beast. After that, everything gets hazy with random images flashing but not enough to piece them together. But it’s not what I remember, it’s what I feel.”
	
	“Which is?”
	
	“I feel horrible. I don’t remember what happened, but I can still feel the pain that the beast felt every time you guys struck it. I felt like I was watching my own parent die in front of me. I know it had to do with whatever it did to me, but, there’s still a piece of me that’s overly sad about it being dead. It’s fading, but it’s there. But I keep wondering, why me? It could’ve scratched anyone, why did it choose to scratch me?”
	
	[[“It’s over now, let’s try to move on.”]]
	[[“It saw a dummy and took advantage.”]]
	[[“Do you feel anything lingering?”]]
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	I nod to the nurse as I enter Winfrey’s room, her parents off to the side speaking to a police officer. I would have to make this quick, especially since Winfrey miraculously was returned with no signs of foul play.
	
	“How are you holding up?” I question.
	
	“Good, I think. I remember some of the stuff that happened, but there are some holes too.”
	
	“Probably due to when you were going feral and weren’t yourself.”
	
	“Yea, I can’t believe I was playing house with the thing that killed my dog. What was it you guys called it?”
	
	“A cryptid,” I glance over at her parents, “what did you tell them?”
	
	“That I went out trying to kill whatever killed Jessie, and ended up being jumped by someone, never saw their faces though. I told them that Bradley and Sydero found me since you told me that you weren’t &#39;there&#39;.” She gives me a questioning look, but I ignore it. The less she knew, the better.

	“You know, the weirdest thing isn’t that I don’t remember much, only what I remember feeling.”
	
	“Which is?”
	
	“I can still feel the pain that the beast felt every time you guys struck it. I felt like I was watching my own parent die in front of me.

“Winfrey, I know you don’t know me that well ... but we could really use your help right now. I know that you’re just confused, and you don’t know what’s going on. But that’s what we’re here for. We need to know how to subdue BB, how to turn you back.”

She blinks her eyes, staring at me with an expressionless face. Her gazes towards an impatient Sydero and a hopeful Bradley, looking back towards me.

“Oh, okay,” she asks quietly, just loud enough for me to hear her, “I know how to calm it down. When I give you the signal then come out and subdue it.” She clenches her head, “and do it quickly, I can’t fight this much longer.” We agree and send Winfrey out the door, waiting for her signal. She slowly approaches BB who calms down tremendously upon seeing her.

“I’m here,” I hear her say, detecting a bit of happiness in her tone. I seem to not be the only one who hears it, Syd gazing over at me and raising a brow. I had faith in her.

She squats down, and BB sniffs her over, bringing her figure closer to it. If it weren’t such a weird picture, then it would almost be cute. As I stare at the two, I see Winfrey motion for us to come.

“You take the left,” Syd says, slipping out the room first with me right behind her. She nods and we both dash forward, blades at the ready as we rush towards BB’s unaware figure. When BB finally notices us, it’s too late.

Sydero rams into BB’s side and I grab Winfrey, yanking her backward across the concrete. It cries as Sydero slams her pistol down on its head constantly, its eyes on Winfrey’s figure as the light begins to fade out.

“No!” she suddenly cries and lurches forward.

“Keep her back,” Sydero orders, giving BB one last knock upside the head before murmuring some words. I tighten my arms around Winfrey as she struggles pathetically against me.

“You’re hurting it!” Winfrey cries, turning to push me but I don’t budge.

“Hey, easy there, $name,” Bradley says, taking a step towards me.

I ignore him, “alright, this is how this is going to go. We’re going to let you go back to BB.” I suppose she still has an ounce of humanity inside of her, seeing her eyes light up in fear and revulsion.

“Whoa, we’re doing what?” Sydero asks, bewildered and brow raised as she looks to Bradley who is the same amount of confused.

“You heard me. If she wants to go so bad, then I say we let her go. I’m tired of fighting for someone who doesn’t want to fight for herself.”

“Get out of my face,” I sigh, releasing her. She stays where she is, trying to prove me wrong but her instincts overwhelm her. She rushes to the door, checking to see if Bradley or Sydero would follow. They don’t move, staring at her as she practically sprints to BB.

I stand in the doorway watching them when Sydero comes by my side, watching them as well. BB was angled so that most of its back was pointed towards us. And luckily, its hulking figure blocked Winfrey’s view.

&lt;&lt;if $athleticism &gt;= 10&gt;&gt;\
	“Plant your dagger somewhere and get the girl out of there, I’ll do the rest before the damn thing bleeds out,” Sydero directs, handing me my blade. I take it and gather up my speed, sprinting as quickly and quietly as I can towards BB’s great frame. I do exactly as she says once there, plunging my blade into BB’s neck and then grabbing Winfrey.

	I hear BB roar behind me but turn just in time to see Sydero ram into BB’s side. It cries as Sydero slams her pistol down on its head constantly, its eyes on Winfrey’s figure as the light begins to fade out.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“Let me take the lead, I’ll handle BB, just get the girl out of there,” Sydero directs. I nod, giving her more room. She takes off in a blindingly fast sprint, and once upon BB, plunges her dagger into its neck. I do exactly as she says once I make it to Winfrey, grabbing her and putting distance between us and the beast. It cries as Sydero slams her pistol down on its head constantly, its eyes on Winfrey’s figure as the light begins to fade out.
					
	“You liar!” she screams, trying to fight me but putting up a weak fight. 

	“Keep her back,” Sydero orders, giving BB one last knock upside the head before murmuring some words. I tighten my arms around Winfrey as she struggles pathetically against me.

	“You’re hurting it!” Winfrey cries, turning to push me but I don’t budge.

Destroy the hearts, and that might put a damper on whatever BB was hoping for. I didn’t have a lighter, but there was a good chance that Sydero did. But for me to be able to ask her, I needed some breathing room. I wait for him to approach, blocking his strikes and when I get an opening, I push him to the ground roughly.

“Syd, lighter?” I shout, barely dodging Chris’s charging figure. I jump to the side, slipping on a puddle of slick blood. When I turn, Chris is right there. I get ready to dart, but he bears his weight down on me, pinning me to the ground and growling.

He does, but avoiding Sydero and the pit of hearts is harder than I thought. The clearing was only so big, and he gets too close for comfort many times. 
			
I feel his presence beside me, and he grabs my shirt. I dance out of his grasp but stumble backward, slipping on a puddle of slick blood. When I turn, Chris is right there. I get ready to dart, but he bears his weight down on me, pinning me to the ground and growling.

Once he moves his leg off, I shoot my knee straight up towards Chris’s groin. His eyes bulge, and he instantly rolls off of me, howling in pain. He might be acting like a beast, but his anatomy was still human. 

	“Roe!” I hear Syd shout and I look up, barely able to catch the lighter she throws my way.

	I get to my feet and grab some of the twigs and leaves, lighting them on fire before tossing it onto the hearts. BB roars lightly, shaking from its current position.

He was close, and I’ve seen it work on a ton of movies. The opponent always getting blindsided by the kiss and freezing. But they were human, and no cryptid virus was actively swimming through their bloodstreams.

Regardless, I go through with the plan, leaning up and placing my lips on top of Chris’s. It’s a simple kiss, one that makes me feel like some shy elementary school kid. But it also does what I intend for it to do. Chris freezes, his eyes staring into mine as I pull back. He blinks and cocks his head slightly.

&lt;&lt;if $heartsonfire&gt;&gt;\
	“$name?” Before I can react, his eyes roll up to the back of his head, and I hear a loud thump. He collapses onto me, with Syd standing behind him, throwing the large branch to the ground. She tosses me the lighter and walks off.

I see her bite the inside of her cheek, looking down at the beast whose breathing is labored. I could see the blood dripping down onto the grass, creating a puddle on the soft cedar colored dirt. Her blade was still nestled in the side of its neck, pulling it out would mean quickening its death.
	
BB picks up its head and roars softly for Chris, even attempting to crawl towards him.
	
“No,” Chris moans, trying to move and get to BB, “don’t do this,” he begs. Neither Sydero nor I say anything, ignoring the whimpering that both of them make, blocking it out until Bradley shows up.

He comes rushing into the clearing, stopping short at the stick barricade. Dangling from his shoulder is Sydero’s book bag and gripped tightly in his hand is his phone.

“Roe, hold Chris down,” Sydero commands, taking her bag from Bradley and rummaging through it. She hands Bradley a bowl, and he heads over towards BB. I’m aware of what those blue eyes are focused on. Not on Chris, but me. Its eyes stare straight at me, perhaps wanting me to look at where my choices have led.

“It’s for Chris,” I hear Bradley murmur, grabbing his own knife and cutting into BB’s side, blood pours out, and he catches some of it in the bowl, approaching me.

He shivers slightly but steels himself, “I need some blood from Chris next.” I nod, watching as he gets the blood from the infected wound that BB had given him. Chris panics, but I manage to hold him still for both his and Bradley’s sake. Bradley sets the bowl down, and Sydero has in her hands that illuminating blue liquid that I had seen in her bag before. She pours half of the small bottle into the bowl and then mixes it with a spoon.

“He has to drink this.” She hands the bowl to me, “quick, before BB is dead.” Bradley helps lift his head up, and I force the contents in the bowl into his mouth, covering his mouth with my hand, forcing him to swallow. Chris’s body begins to convulse quickly when suddenly he stops, he is entirely still. I reach forward, mostly to see if he’s still alive, when he suddenly rolls over onto his stomach, vomiting onto the pavement.

“You back with us, Chris?” I inquire.

He breathes harshly, spitting before looking up at me, “what the hell happened?”

“It won’t if you try to get over it.”

“You get over a girlfriend dumping you, $name. You don’t just get over being turned into something that shouldn’t exist.” The two of us fall silent, neither wanting to continue the conversation.

“So,” I start, “you don’t remember anything? Nothing that happened?”

“Your beverage,” the barista states, sliding me my receipt and beverage. I thank her and turn to look at my surroundings.

She sets her cup down, staring at me, unamused, “I’d be damned if I can’t. Either I’m ahead, or everyone else is, and that doesn’t fly with me.”

“For someone who hates plans and thinking ahead, you sure do it a lot.”	
“I just don’t like how our odds are beginning to look,” she tells me impatiently.
		
“What does that mean?”

	“A feeling is all.” It didn’t take much for me to figure out that she was just leaving out information like she was known to do, but I knew that questioning her would lead nowhere. She taps the table and motions for me to come on, I suppose she was ready to leave. I follow behind her, calling out to Bradley and Chris.

“Oh thanks, Ol’ Wise One, for the useless words,” she snorts, “we either learn now, or we’re going to be horribly blindsided by them, and I don’t do blindsides ... unless I’m the one doing them.” I continue to sip my drink, silence setting in as we both gaze out at the busy café.

“I got wind of another job,” he sings, unphased by the looks that we all give him. No one disagrees, mostly since none of us had a better idea, and I certainly didn’t want to head back to the safehouse.

“Alright, send me the coordinates,” I put my car in drive and peel out into the street, leaving the town behind us. Leaving Bladenboro behind.

I snort, sending bubbles over the surface of my drink. Both teens look up, finally noticing me, “seriously, Bradley? The most dangerous thing you face is your fingers cramping up from typing.” Hillary giggles while Bradley turns three shades of the brightest red I’ve ever seen.

“Hacking is a lot of work too,” he squeaks out, clearing his throat and changing the conversation.

“So, I guess you’ll be leaving soon?” Hillary questions, playing with her fingers.
		
“Yea, I just want you to know that it was amazing to meet you. Like, you’re always the real MVP when we game and, I mean it’s an honor to finally meet the gamer behind the tag.” Bradley fights his blush, rubbing his arm as he compliments Hillary.

“Please tell me this is my bed,” I hear Sydero say, jerking in my spot to see her resting nearby, or who I think is her. Voice-wise, it’s her, no doubt. But appearance is another thing entirely.

&lt;&lt;link [img[images/divider.png]] &gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/link&gt;&gt;
“You were right, we’re in my book. The one I was reading before all of this happened.”
				
“I’m sure that should make me feel better, but it doesn’t,” Sydero sighs, “we know where we are but not why, how, or anything –”

&lt;&lt;link [img[images/divider.png]] &gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/link&gt;&gt;
She shakes her head, “no. What I feel is not that. This spirit is not the same.” I take a deep breath in and out, for the first time ever, I wish for the Entity to speak. But of course, the one time I need it, they don’t. The Entity … wasn’t the Entity?

&lt;&lt;link [img[images/divider.png]] &gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/link&gt;&gt;
“$name,” I hear the Entity speak, his voice on the edge of my consciousness, sounding uncharacteristically calm, “she has the power to kill you. Let me help.”

The tendril holds me in place as she glares at me in the face, “you will pay.” The tendril squeezes. Though it is merely a tendril, I can feel it prickling my skin.

“$name!” the Entity shouts, “just let me take control. Don’t let your pride kill you.” I’m slipping, I can feel that much, and staring into her eyes, I know that no sympathy rests within them.

The feeling of having all of your senses nulled in a mysterious place is possibly the weirdest experience to have. I could hear just fine, but I wasn’t familiar with the sounds coming from deeper within. Fire crackling, a deep and melodic hum, and something else, something that I couldn’t put my finger on. I could also feel, but of course when you’re in a pitch-black hallway that doesn’t allow for one’s eyes to refocus, then it was hard to figure out what you were touching.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	This building was unnecessarily cold. And as I follow behind Sydero, listening to the sounds of my footsteps echoing off the tile floor, that thought is what stays at the forefront of my mind. My own footsteps were constantly reminding me that I was making too much noise, but didn’t give me a way to cease it. I knew there was some secret to it, since I couldn&#39;t hear Sydero, but knew that she resides ahead of me due to me constantly bumping into her when she stopped. Even Chris was silent, the loudest thing about him was his uncontrolled breathing. The deeper we went, the more fearful he became.

&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“I think we’re here,” Sydero says, stopping at what I can only presume is a door, “remember, witches die just like any mortal.” I nod, reaching for my gun to make sure it was still there, could never be too careful.

Sydero pushes the door open and we dash inside, but there’s no one there.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“I think you got the wrong room, Syd,” Chris points out, lowering the gun in his hands.
	
	“Shut up,” Syd growls, shoving him out of the way and walking towards a reversed pentagram. She crouches and begins going through a large mixing bowl that sits at one of the points.
	
	The room was a complete mess, even if they weren’t here now, they were a few minutes ago. This room holds at least three windows, but each had shabby wood panels blocking the outside world. The floor held a mix of dirt, trash, and what I can only assume was animal feces. Large holes rest on the floor, while smaller ones can be seen in the ceiling. The ones in the ceiling had small horrible patchwork done to them, the floor ones were left untreated.

	“What are you doing?” I ask Syd who picks up several thick strands of what looks like cheese. She sniffs it and frowns.

	“Ginger root. Ginger root. Ginger root,” she repeats again and again, tapping her foot.

	“What about it?” Chris questions.

	“I forget what it’s used for, it’s the only thing in that bowl I don’t know. Shit! What is it used for,” she shouts in frustration.

	“Passion, wealth, success, long life, it has many uses young one,” a voice says behind us. We each twist around to see a group of six men and women enter the room. The one in front, and I suppose the speaker, is an old crone with a cigarette resting in her loose grasp. “But for us, we’re using it for means of power.” She lifts a finger and everyone behind her surges forward to attack.

	Two head for me, one for Chris, and the other two have their eyes set on Syd, but she seems more interested in the old woman.

&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“Don’t go near the pentagram!” Syd screams before engaging her assaulters.

The two heading towards me was a man and a woman. The woman was remarkably smaller than the man but would get to me first.

[[Take out the woman’s leg.]]
[[Use the environment to my advantage.]]
[[Trick the lady.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1062" name="Take out the woman’s leg." tags="" position="0,4512" size="100,100">I raise my gun and aim for the woman’s leg, hoping to slow her down. She was remarkably deft on her feet, managing to avoid each of the three shots aimed at her. Her power could have to do with agility, no normal human could move like that. I discover her power, but I also do no damage, and she is upon me. I begin to throw a punch when she swiftly dodges it and strikes me in my stomach, kicking my feet out from under me.

//Cute//, I think to myself, rolling out of the way before the guy could deliver a punch. She was fast, but lucky for me I scrimmage with a woman whose style was similar to hers, only the woman I scrimmage with was quicker and a lot more ruthless and a lot less sloppy. Syd taught me how to read others, and I personally learned how to combat her style of fighting.

She screams in agony as she goes down, lunging out and bringing her leg closer to her. Hopefully, she didn’t have some insta-heal potion, because I had to deal with her friend now.
&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	
	“Hey, could use some help over here!” Chris shouts, and I look just in time to see his body get flung across the room.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

The man is upon me before I can plan my next moves, he grabs my wrist and wrestles the gun out of my hands, it goes skidding across the floor, almost falling into one of the holes. Great.
&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	
	“Busy!” I shout back.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

I try to shove the man off of me, but his grip is unyielding, in one smooth move, he lifts me up and tosses me over his shoulder. I hear his footsteps, carrying them towards me. I gaze around, searching for anything to give me an advantage.

[[Lunge towards him.]]
[[Use the ... animal droppings.]]
[[Put more space between us.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1063" name="Lunge towards him." tags="" position="0,4727" size="100,100">Nothing rests around me, and so my possibilities grow tremendously small. Only being able to think of one thing, I decide to lunge for the man coming towards me, taking out his legs. He joins me on the ground, both of us now on equal ground.
						
&lt;&lt;if $style is &quot;Aikido&quot;&gt;&gt;\
	In all honesty, this wasn’t equal at all. My style wasn’t suitable for both of us being on the floor, instead, it was better for both of us to be standing. I guess I didn’t think that part through. I improvise, just raining down punch after punch until his head rolls to the side and all of his fight disappears.
&lt;&lt;elseif $style is &quot;Kenpo&quot;&gt;&gt;\
	I immediately surge forward, striking him two times in his stomach and then placing a perfectly timed palm strike to his face when he sits up. As soon as his head goes back, hitting the ground, I strike his face again and then get to my feet, stomping his head next.
&lt;&lt;elseif $style is &quot;Taekwondo&quot;&gt;&gt;\
	This wasn’t my ideal position for fighting, but there was little I can do. I crawl back just enough to give my leg the necessary room it needs to execute the move I was envisioning. The man sits up and is about to lunge for me when I push up, and then kick my leg out. The force of my leg whips across his face, sending him straight back to the ground. It probably wasn’t hard enough to crack his neck or anything, but he would be out for some time.
&lt;&lt;elseif $style is &quot;Judo&quot;&gt;&gt;\
	I roll over him so that I was in the position to use a chokehold move. While wrapping one of my legs around his midsection, one hand reaches out and grabs his thigh, the other settling on his collar. I apply pressure to this, and though the action is slow, he slowly loses all fight and his head rolls to the side.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	I immediately move on top of him and begin raining down punches, not giving him a second to put his guard fully up. I keep it coming, watching as his face begins to turn from its usual peachy tone to one of red. My actions leave multicolored bruises on his face and my fists. His blood stains my fingers, and only when his guard totally goes down do I stop. His head rolls to the side, and I get to my feet, just now realizing that I was breathing harshly.

It was sick, but it would give me some much-needed time. Just don’t think about it, I tell myself and reach out and grab it. I chuck it straight at the man’s face and with his attention elsewhere, race to my gun.

I grab it with my cleaner hand and take the shot, the bullet soaring through his chest. He takes two more steps before falling face first to the floor.

&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
I pistol whip her, rolling my eyes at the long speech that she probably had prepared for me. I’ll let Syd kill her, I still wasn’t comfortable with the idea of taking another’s life.
									
“You’re such a weak and pathetic little thing,” the Entity sighs, their words echoing off the sides of my head. I mentally tell them to shut up before putting my attention on the rest of the room. I still had the man to deal with.

	“Hey, could use some help over here!” Chris shouts, and I look just in time to see his body get flung across the room.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

The man is upon me before I can plan my next moves, he grabs my wrist and wrestles the gun out of my hands, it goes skidding across the floor, almost falling into one of the holes. Great.
&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	
	“Busy!” I shout back.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

I try to shove the man off of me, but his grip is unyielding, in one smooth move, he lifts me up and tosses me over his shoulder. I hear his footsteps, carrying them towards me. I gaze around, searching for anything to give me an advantage.

[[Lunge towards him.]]

I aim and shoot, my heart lurching just a little at the sight and feeling. Like last time, a small piece of me comes alive, it revels in the sensation. It wasn’t necessarily the act of taking a life that awakens this half of me, more so the act of being around a new soul who has walked across the veil.

“Hmm, it tastes nice, doesn’t it?” the Entity questions, their low laugh giving me a slight headache. I mentally tell them to shut up before putting my attention on the rest of the room. I still had the man to deal with.

Backing up was no longer an option. The only direction now was forward, though I guess I could go to the side, but that only leads to the hallway where Sydero and the old woman fights.

&lt;&lt;if $style is &quot;Aikido&quot;&gt;&gt;\
	I let the man come to me, blocking the two punches that he sends my way. On the third punch, I block it and then grab his fist, using my free hand to come down on the cubital part of his arm. He falls to his knees, easily allowing me to straighten out his hand and push him farther down. I put my knee on the back of his neck and take advantage of his exposed pressure point.
&lt;&lt;elseif $style is &quot;Kenpo&quot;&gt;&gt;\
	I immediately surge forward, striking him two times in his stomach and then placing a perfectly timed palm strike to his face, shoving him hard enough so that he falls to the ground. As soon as his head goes back, hitting the ground, I strike his face again and then get to my feet, stomping his head next.
&lt;&lt;elseif $style is &quot;Taekwondo&quot;&gt;&gt;\
	He continues to come towards me, and when he gets close enough, I deliver a high-powered and precise kick to the side of his face. A teacher would probably scold me on my stance and other areas, but the kick did what I needed it to do. The man falls to the ground with a large thump.
&lt;&lt;elseif $style is &quot;Judo&quot;&gt;&gt;\
	I walk towards him and once close enough, hook my leg under his to throw off his balance. I throw all of my weight onto him and place my elbow near his collarbone, as we head down I let gravity do the rest, timing when I apply pressure. I do it as soon as he hits, and his body does a slight bounce back up, my elbow keeping him down. I hear air, and a surprised groan escape him, but he doesn’t get back up.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	As soon as he gets into striking distance, I hit him with two jabs and then, upon seeing an opening, an uppercut. He stumbles back, and I push on, throwing out more punches until my actions leave multicolored bruises on his face and my fists. His blood stains my fingers, and only when his guard totally goes down do I stop. His body hits the floor, and I flex out my sore fist.

There were furniture and other objects all around the room. Obstacles that she wouldn’t be able to maneuver around so well. I shoot towards a lone table with plates, and other items on it – items that I didn’t want to know the name of. I grab the plate and toss it toward her, watching as she dodges it with finesse. She begins to round the table, and I play the game of moving at the same time. She realizes this and chuckles, jumping on top of the table. Without doing much thinking, I push the table as hard as I can, watching as she falls on her face.

The man is getting closer, I needed to deal with her quickly.

[[Knock her out.]]

I trip the guy and put space between him and me, putting my gun on safety before aiming for the woman and taking the shot. Of course, nothing happens, but she didn’t know that. She dodges the invisible bullet, and in those few seconds, valuable seconds that give me an opening while her body still adjusted to the dodge, I take my second shot. My finger flips the safety back off, and I aim for her leg, hitting her shin straight on.

She screams in agony as she goes down, lunging out and bringing her leg closer to her. Hopefully, she didn’t have some insta-heal potion, because I had to deal with her friend now.

	The building is again quiet, all the witches and warlocks taken care of. I go to Chris’s side, mostly since I couldn’t find where Sydero was.
	
	“Good job,” I say, helping him to his feet.
	
	“Yea, no thanks to you.”

	“Seriously?” I had to deal with two to your one, I couldn’t just drop everything to come and save your butt.”

	The building is again quiet, all the witches and warlocks taken care of. I approach some of the bodies to make sure they were down for good, mostly since I couldn’t find where Sydero was.

	“I feel like I threw out my own back trying to put that old bag down,” Sydero states, coming back in, her hand on her hip. I don’t say anything to her as I continue checking the bodies. That, and Sydero had made a good point a few hunts ago – looting bodies was not something that only video game characters do.

	While I check bodies, Sydero approaches the reversed pentagram with interest.
	
	“This coven wasn’t made up by some amateur witches who didn’t know what they were doing,” Sydero starts. She crouches down and lightly traces her fingers over the pentagram. “Yea, they were the real deal.”

“I feel like I threw out my own back trying to put that old bag down,” Sydero states, coming back in, her hand on her hip. She raises a brow at the tension between Chris and me, looking back and forth in interest. “And what did I just interrupt?”

“I suppose,” she shrugs, grabbing the body closest to her and ripping off part of her shirt. With the fabric in hand, she begins to wipe whatever material was used to make the pentagram. She breaks the symbol and motions to follow her out. We were done with this, and that’s all that I could hope for.

Despite my tiredness, I have a small skip in my step as we walk back to the car and then drive to the motel. There’s only one thing that could make me happier, and when we get back to the motel, we find it sitting on the table waiting.

“Sorry, I was hungry,” Bradley snickers as the rest of us instantly see what is left. I grab some nuggets and fries, grabbing a book as I go to the bed I had claimed.

Bradley grabs a pack of cards and sits at the table, “did it all go well?”

“Yea, good intel by the way. How’d you track them?” Sydero asks, grabbing a seat while she eats her fries.

“It was pure luck, I connected dots from their last home, it was the only way I realized what and who they were. They kept their noses down mostly, I mean I easily figured out they were witches, but if it weren’t for that one slip up, I would’ve never known.”

Half of the reason we were on the move was that of the police. They weren’t giving up on me, and it had made the job harder for us. Another reason was that we needed the money. When you had four mouths to feed, house, and keep up with – money wasn’t the easiest thing to keep. Most of the hunts we’ve been on have been just that, hunts. Sydero wanting Chris and me to get more acquainted to the job before attempting to take on a specialist job.

There were times where I felt like there was an EDM concert going on in my head. The repetitive thumping would at times bring me to my knees.

		“It’s your job to call //me// out, I’m not about to just out myself for your pleasure,” she snorts.

		“I mean, your poker face is a bit too good Syd,” Bradley says, his words causing Syd to smile proudly.

		Chris points an accusing finger at Syd, “I know you have a tell, I just gotta figure out what it is.”

		She leans in, cocking her head to the side as if she had some deep secret to share, “good luck, and it’s your turn.” Chris snorts and slams down his card. “Bullshit.” Bradley picks up the card, proving that Syd was right and that Chris was about to have a very large pile of cards now.

		“You want in, $name?” Bradley asks, his gaze on me as he fiddles with the cards in his hand. I can only assume that it’s his turn.
	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\

		“Playing one on one with you is exhausting, any of you want in?” Bradley questions, snatching the cards from Sydero’s hand and then shuffling them.

		“No thanks, I’m reading,” Chris tells them, and I peek out to get a better look, seeing //The Lore// in his hands.

		“If you think that book is supposed to save you from getting your ass kicked then you have another thing coming. The best way to learn is from experience,” Sydero tells him, motioning for Bradley to continue his shuffling.

		I look over at him and nod, “I can agree to that. The book is more so to give you the basic information on the things we might find, and their weaknesses.”

		“Thanks, for the –,” he pauses as he looks for a suitable word, “advice. But I’m going to continue reading.” Aggravation is laced within his words, causing all three of us to raise a brow.

		“I’m guessing we’re playing BS?” I question, putting my stuff in the trash and then sitting between Chris and Bradley.

		“You guess right. Chris, give $name six cards,” Bradley commands, and just like that, I was in the game.

		I begin to see Chris’s frustration with Sydero. She puts down cards so casually, and after attempting to call her out, I find that whether she was lying or not, she had no facial tics to give such information away. Bradley’s tale was that he rubbed his lips together, making extra sure to avoid eye contact. While Chris tilted his head to the side and it was always paired with some kind of action. Whether that meant he leaned in his chair, rubbed his forehead, or just messed with his clothes.

		Syd though, I couldn’t notice anything. And after a few rounds, she retires knowing that we were all playing to call her out.
	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
		I shrug and close my book, moving it to the side as I also collect my trash.

		“I’m guessing we’re playing BS?” I question, putting my stuff in the trash and then sitting beside Bradley.

		“You guess right,” Bradley tells me as he passes out the cards, each of us getting eight.

		I begin to see Bradley’s frustration with Sydero. She puts down cards so casually, and after attempting to call her out, I find that whether she was lying or not, she had no facial tics to give such information away.

Feet, shuffling across broken floorboards, causing dust to take flight. Body, shaking as eyes go from one familiar face to the other. These faces weren’t just faces that she saw on a daily basis, forced to deal with them and their obnoxious stories and thoughts. These faces were family. People who she adored and grew up among. People who taught her all she knew and helped her understand that amongst a sea full of normality, she was to be something amazing. They shielded her from the bigots and taught her the true meaning of unity.

And now, now they lay at her feet, bathing in a pool of their own blood. Spilled for no other purpose but fear and hatred. Her trembling turned to sobs, and her sobs to screams. Her knees buckled as she collapsed near the woman who took her in, who showed her that death was not an option. Mother Circe, they all called her. The wisest and oldest of them. It was she who had adopted all of them, bringing them into a coven – a family. But only she now remained.

Shakily, she got to her feet and headed towards the shelf next to their now destroyed pentagram. If her memory serves correct, Mother Circe hid her spellbook here, full of all the magic she knew. This was supposed to be a joyous night, one that was to end with her being a fully recognized witch. She flipped through the pages until she came to the spell in question.

Completing it was no problem. The ingredients were either gathered already or could be found in the building. The worst part was repairing the pentagram, having to use the blood of her fallen sister.

Plus, I was at an enticing part, the wedding was approaching, and the blood assassin was about to have to make a choice on whether to kill her prince or to aid him.

She goes back to the bowl, chanting the words and performing the ritual as it was meant. She waits patiently for the sign to say that it works when she hears whispers in the bowl.

“Speak,” it screeches lowly, drawing out the word.

“A hunter group has decimated my coven – your coven, I wish to seek guidance on how you wish for me to continue.”

“I have seen their faces,” it hisses in disgust, “and their deaths will come soon enough.” An unseen wind begins to turn the pages of the spell book. “Read and gather and execute.” The voice disappears, and the ripples within the blood disappear, leaving the girl alone yet again. She returns to the book, her eyes skimming over the words – reading, gathering, so that she could execute.

Later that night I close my eyes, feeling as if I was stuck in a maze. Despite how many different twists I take, I always end up at the beginning, utterly miffed about my state of being.

“Try one more time, you’re bound to get out of here someway,” the Entity chuckles menacingly overhead. I gaze up and see an endless dreary grey sky.

“Why can’t we go back to a week ago? When you were silent?” I continue on, turning to see if that would do anything, but it only sets me back at the beginning.

“You say this as if you don’t have full control here. The reason I’m still here is because you want me here, you enjoy this.”

“Tell me how to get rid of you, and I’ll do it.”

“I’m not really here, $name,” they chuckle, their voice going in and out, much like a radio signal on an unknown country backroad.

[[Try and get rid of them.]]

&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
I take a deep breath and focus on erasing them.
		
“Focus,” I hear them repeat in my ear. I finally open my eyes, but I see no one there, the voice stopping along with it.
		
“You lie,” I scowl, “you’re here. This isn’t my imagination.”
		
“You sure? You have a pretty wild imagination. But it’s fine, you’re just using me as an excuse. You like being messed up in the head, you’re psychotic, and I’m your fall back plan.” Suddenly, they appear in front of me, a goofy relaxed smile is there, but that’s all that is there. 

They throw their hands in the air and squeal, “guys, I have this voice in my head, it’s not me, it’s the voice. Please believe me.” Their form disappears as they chuckle, disappearing. “Pathetic.”

As soon as they say this, blackness creeps in, devouring everything until I am surrounded by it. The ground disappears, and I feel myself falling, my heart picking up as the thought of dying comes to mind. I kick and scream, attempting to grab something but my body just falls faster, faster, faster. Until I am no longer falling, but the blackness devours me as well.

&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
I ignore them. Speaking to them will go nowhere, and I don’t have time to waste on them, especially when I need to get out of here. I continue to try different paths, even trying to climb to see if this maze was just one big trap.
		
“Look at you,” they sigh, sitting on a bench that wasn’t there before, “you’re stuck in your own mind, determined to get out of it. Now, what sane person does that?”
	
“A sane person wouldn’t be trapped in their own mind.”
		
“No, a sane person wouldn’t think of their mind as a trap. They would see it as a delightful retreat from the wicked world. Hmm, I think I’m onto something,” they chuckle, “this //is// your retreat, $name. You messed up devil you. You like this, which is why you keep me around when you can snap your fingers, and I’d disappear.” With a blank face, I snap my fingers, their figure still there. “Idiot, you have to //want// me to go. You are slowly losing your mind and your grip on reality. And you like it.”

“What do you mean, I can get rid of you at any time? I’ve been trying this, and you don’t seem to go anywhere.”
		
“Hmm,” they state, tapping their chin, or what I believe is their chin, “maybe that’s because you secretly like me, like this?”
		
“That’s crazy,” I snort.
		
“Is it? I disappeared for years not because I wanted to, but because I had no choice. Because I am a figment of your imagination. And now, when your life goes to shit, you suddenly think me back up. I have no control over my existence, in your hands rest it all.”
		
“If you cared about your existence then you wouldn’t tell me this.” I believe I’ve won the debate when the Entity chuckles, appearing in front of me.
		
“I tell you this because I have no fear,” they lean in, “because you enjoy this wickedness, and you never want to see it gone again.”

	I gasp, shooting upwards. I feel severely lightheaded, and no matter how many times I inhale, I can’t seem to take in enough air. I felt like I was drowning in invisible water. My mind and eyesight adjust slowly. One look at my surroundings and I jump back in fright and confusion. I wasn’t even inside a building anymore, let alone the motel. I sit outside, a darkened sky resting above though this doesn’t quite make it hard to see. The ground is the color of coal, with specks of different grays sprinkled in. There are trees and plants but they too show only shades that would reside on a grayscale image. Everything was just abysmal and dead. A world without color or contrast.
	
	“I think I landed on something hard,” I hear Sydero say. Jerking in my spot, I see her resting nearby, or who I think is her. Voice-wise, it’s her, no doubt. But appearance is another thing entirely. She is a pale brown, as if someone had colored her but then drained all saturation from her body. Her iris itself is black, appearing like any normal iris would, but her sclera is all red.
	
	&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
		“Yea, that would be me,” Chris groans and I look but see that he is himself. Instead of his clothes. They remind me of medieval times, not that of a peasant or noble though, perhaps a soldier? Chris gazes around, his face falling.
		
		“Where the hell are we?”

		“The hell, Roe?” Sydero grimaces, looking me up and down, “what is this, cosplay? Why do you look like that?”
		
		“You’re the one to talk,” I snort.

		“Both of you are looking pretty ridiculous,” Chris tells us, getting to his feet, “you look like some wannabe vampire.” I gaze down at my hand and find myself staring at a dark grey skin tone.

		“Where are we!” Chris repeats, less patience and more panic in his voice.
	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
		“Well, you did land on the ground,” I tell her, gazing at our surroundings yet again.

My mind and eyesight adjust slowly. One look at my surroundings and I jump back in fright and confusion. I wasn’t even inside a building anymore, let alone the motel. I sit outside, a cheerful bright pastel blue sky resting above, hardly a cloud in the sky. The grass in which I sit in is decorated with colorful wildflowers, and further out, a forest resides. The grass is a lovely chartreuse, and oddly soft. The type of grass that one would run through and then fall in happiness, sleeping under the sun.

	“Please tell me this is my bed,” I hear Sydero say. Jerking in my spot, I see her resting nearby, or who I think is her. Voice-wise, it’s her, no doubt. But appearance is another thing entirely.

		“The hell, Roe?” Sydero grimaces, looking me up and down, “what is this, cosplay? Why are you dressed like that?”

		“You’re the one to talk,” I snort.

		“Agreed,” Chris speaks, getting to his feet, “Syd looks like some wannabe vampire.” While she freaks out about her new skin tone, I look down at my clothes. My clothes are similar to Chris’s, but mine appear much more formal.

		“Where are we!” Chris repeats, less patience and more panic in his voice.
	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
		“Close, but not quite,” I tell her, gazing at our surroundings yet again.

		“Well, if I had to guess, I&#39;d say we were in that book you were reading, $name. What was it called?&quot; Sydero asks, fiddling with her clothing.
		
		“Um, For the Crown, I think. Some kind of medieval style book with assassins and crap. We should be safe, right? We just gotta get out of here?” I ask, and of course, my words only doom us further. We all hear an animal snort and turn to see a group approaching us, and they don&#39;t look too friendly.

		We stand frozen as the soldier’s approach on mountable armored lizards, each a different color than the lizard standing beside them, yet each the same amount of fearsome. Once at a safe distance, the soldiers disappear from the back of their lizards, and I make out their shadows gliding across the ground towards us. They materialize directly in front of us, their weapons on their back, and one of the soldiers grabbing Chris harshly.
		
		“Fine work catching the Alyrian,” one of them says, his eyes on Chris. They land on us next, and with a raised brow he looks us over, “I do not believe we have met. Or have we?” Syd pushes me forward, and I clear my throat.
		
		“Uh, no sir. Guess we haven’t had the pleasure.” They each look at me, raising a brow at something I said I suppose.
		
		“Ah, well I am Asher, Shadow Assassin of the Deadlands.” Oh crap, Sydero had guessed correctly, this was my story. I distinctly remember Asher’s character, and even if I had somehow forgotten the name of the sarcastic loveable assassin, him claiming that he is a shadow assassin was enough to tell me. I suppose my panicked look shows clearly on my face, as Asher’s eyes widen and he tries to calm me down.
	
		“Do not worry,” he chuckles, “I am not as ill-tempered as my partner, the blood assassin. Between you and me, I am the nice one.” His words calm me, but only because they prove that I was showing far too much emotion. I look over at Sydero who stands in confusion, possibly waiting for me to tell her why I was suddenly beginning to panic.
		
		“Oh, of course, I’m sorry sir. But yea, as you can see, we’ve captured the Alyrian.” We all turn to Chris who stares at me as if I betrayed him. I give him the slyest wink I can, hoping that he would just let whatever happens happen. Asher nods, approaching him.
		
		“A soldier I suppose,” Asher growls, “not dressed like the spies I have seen. Who sent you to our lands? The King?” 

		With his attention on Chris, Sydero quietly approaches me, tapping me on the side as she whispers in my ear, “exactly what the hell is going on?”
	
		[[“Does it look like I know? You’re the weirdo expert.”]]
		[[“You were right, we’re in my book.”]]
		[[“Apparently Chris is a soldier, not a spy.”]]

		We stand frozen as the soldier’s approach on mountable armored lizards, each a different color than the lizard standing beside them, yet each the same amount of fearsome. Once at a safe distance, the soldiers disappear from the back of their lizards, and I make out their shadows gliding across the ground towards us. They materialize directly in front of us, their weapons still sheathed. As soon as they get a good look at us, they calm down, their shoulders relaxing.
		
		“Ah, excuse us for the rude introduction,” one of them says, looking almost sheepish, “we have been told to keep a sharp eye on our borders. I do not believe we have met. Or have we?” Syd pushes me forward, and I clear my throat.
		
		“Uh, no sir. Guess we haven’t had the pleasure.” They each look at me, raising a brow at something I said I suppose.

I look over at Sydero who stands in confusion, possibly waiting for me to tell her why I was suddenly beginning to panic. “Have you seen anything worth noting?” 
		
		“No sir, no Alyrians here.” I’m pretty sure that’s what they were called. Asher cocks his head to the side.
		
		“You are not dressed like elite soldiers or soldiers at all.” The two soldiers behind him mumble in agreement, “what are you?”
		
		“Bounty hunters,” I immediately say, knowing that the few bounty hunters they had were far freer to do what they pleased. He nods in acceptance of this. Asher turns to the two soldiers, discussing something with them in a low voice. 
		
		With his attention off of us, Sydero quietly approaches me, tapping me on the side as she whispers in my ear, “exactly what the hell is going on?”
		
		[[“Does it look like I know? You’re the weirdo expert.”]]

	We stand frozen as the soldier’s approach on horseback, whispering to one another. Once close enough, two of them pull out their bow and arrows and aim. Two more hop off of their horses and approach with their swords drawn. The last stays on his horse and pulls out an intimidating double-edged sword. Everyone’s weapon is trained on one figure, Sydero.
		
	“You each got five seconds to point those weapons away from me,” Sydero growls, her voice sounding more feral than ever before.
		
	“Secure the beast,” the double-edged soldier shouts, judging by his uniform and the way the others immediately do as he says, I would think he was their leader.
		
	[[Stop them.]]
	[[Allow them.]]

“I already gave you my best guess.”
				
“I think your best guess is right. I remember him from the book I was reading. I’m just confused about how this could happen.”
				
Sydero is unable to answer when Asher turns back to us, a friendly smile on his lips.

	“Excellent, Lord Doran will wish to speak to you and learn more of how you captured the prisoner. Follow me.” He gives orders for the other two soldiers to mount the same giant lizard, and motions for Sydero and I to mount the free one now. We do as he says, quite unprofessionally and clumsily. While we try to figure out how to work the lizard, Chris is tied to the other soldier’s mount, forced to keep up with the lizard’s gait as they start forward.

&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

Sydero and I take up the rear, putting enough space between us so that we can speak.
		
“What could be powerful enough to send us here?” I whisper to her, “has this ever happened to you before?”
		
“Being transported into a book? No. I’ve been transported to other places though. As for who could’ve done this, the only beings powerful enough are the higher up creatures and witches with demon backing.”
		
“But we killed all the witches, it couldn’t be them, could it?”
		
“We think we killed them all, the bad thing about covens is that you never know who could be hiding or just didn’t show up to the party. For all we know there’s one left. For her to do a spell like this though, she either followed us back and slipped hexes somewhere, or she summoned a demon to aid her.”
	
“Which is worse?”
	
“Definitely the demon summoning. Witches can get insurmountable power from them, most of the time they go too far with this power though and promise things they can’t give.” Sydero’s voice trails off, and her eyes seem to look past everything in front of us. She shakes her head, clearing her throat as she taps the lizard’s side. “But if she is being backed by a demon then she’s here with us, making sure she finishes us off here.”

[[“Did you make a deal with a demon?”]]

“I’m sure that should make me feel better, but it doesn’t,” Sydero sighs, “we know where we are but not why, how, or anything –”

Sydero is unable to finish her statement when Asher turns back to us, a friendly smile on his lips.

I glance at her face, trying and failing to read her. “Did you make a deal with a demon?”

“What?” she shouts in shock, laughing after realizing what I had asked, “hell no. There’s nothing a demon has to offer that I would want.” I’m not wholly sure on her honesty, but I let the question die out, my attention on the town that we were approaching.

It’s one thing to read about fantasy lands in books, to close your eyes and picture what the author was attempting to paint with their words. But it was another to actually be in it, seeing the world in all its fantastical wonder. This was every fantasy and sci-fi loving kid’s dream. Being able to abandon their world and to travel to another where they became the hero and slew the mighty dragon. I chuckle in disbelief, here I was, all because a witch had a vendetta against me.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	The Deadlands was a simple beauty. With Pryce in mind, I’m sure the aesthetic here didn’t match that of the capital in any shape or form. But it still held a sort of simple grandeur to it. Up against the darkened soil and dreary sky and landscape were tawny and cream houses, built up by smooth and un-splintered wood. Crowds of people mill about, going about their business. Only a few stop and look towards Chris, but soon after go back to not caring. Children play games on the side of the street, shrieking as the game continues and victors begin to show themselves.

Many of those we past whisper to one another upon seeing Asher and I notice that he keeps his gaze forward. His shoulders are stiff and his posture even more so.

“You’re going to hate me for this but, do we have a plan?” I ask Sydero.

“More like goals. We need to figure out how to get out of here which might have to do with finding our witch. So, we need to ask around, see if anyone else has popped up. If this world has witches, then that’s who we need to speak to.” I nod, my attention now resting on the enormous castle before us.
		
When thinking of the Deadlands, this would be the first image that would pop in my head. A large and foreboding castle that stood high above all of the other buildings in the area. And yet, even with its dark nature, I felt oddly at peace near it. It was almost welcoming.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“That is a really large and ominous castle, and every fiber in my body is telling me to go inside,” Sydero whistles, nudging me in excitement before hopping off the mount and shooting towards the castle. Passing the soldiers who were escorting a still panicking Chris.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“That is a really large and ominous castle, and every fiber in my body is telling me to go inside,” Sydero whistles, nudging me in excitement before hopping off the mount and shooting towards the castle. Passing the soldiers who were already walking up the stairs.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“Is this the first time she has seen Lord Doran’s castle?” Asher asks me once I catch up to him.

“No, she’s just always excited to see it. She’s a Lord Doran fangirl.” I smile, but Asher gives me another quizzical look.

“You speak oddly, you know?”
	
[[“I blame the jungle folks.”]]
[[“I’m not originally from Pryce but across the sea.”]]

“The kid’s asleep, I’d rather him keep sleeping than save us which is really weird to say.” I suppose I couldn’t blame her. Bradley’s been sleeping routinely every day, but it was just because he was catching up on some much-needed rest. In a day or so, he would be back to not sleeping again for a whole other month. I don’t question her further, not because I didn’t have more to say or ask, but because my attention goes to the town that we were approaching.

“Two things I know might happen. We might slip into a coma-like state, never to wake up but never really dying. Or, we die in both worlds.” She turns to look at me, “either way, dying isn’t really something we want to do.”
				
“You mean we don’t just magically wake up in the real world?” I whimper sadly.

“Maybe, but I highly doubt it. Us being here is an extension of our spirit. You kill someone’s spirit, and they’re what I said earlier.” I open my mouth to question her further but close it a moment later.

“Ah, you must mean those deep within the Kuno Jungle. I have heard strange tales of them.” I nod, hoping that would answer that. Asher could be an asset in helping us get out of here, but I doubt he would believe a word I tell him. It was similar to telling someone in my world that supernatural creatures were real.

“Or you can rely on me to help you get out,” I hear the Entity whisper gently, as if literally right at my side.

“And here I was hoping that world jumping would kick you out,” I snort, thinking the words and projecting them towards them. They couldn’t read my thoughts, but if I thought them with the intention of them hearing, then they could.
		
“When will you learn?” they question, “but no matter. I can help you, you just need to accept me.”

	The corridor that we travel down seems to go on forever. Giving me a perfect amount of time to look around. A handful of wall torches light our path, enough to give me an easy time, but I can guess that Chris was blind. I suppose being Cimmerian had its benefits. Complex and intricate designs carry up the side of the wall and to an arched roof overhead where an even more elaborate painting rests. I don’t know the figures that exist in the painting, but I can only assume that they represented the deities or gods.

	The door in front of us opens, and we walk into a large room full of patrons who stand about, seeming to be there for the aesthetic. It was a bare room that was filled with simple decorations such as paintings, rugs, and small lamp posts. The only thing genuinely worth noting was the throne that sat on a small dais. The throne was completely black with small gold and silver gems positioned in the sides. The gems gave the throne some much-needed color but did nothing to make it look less intimidating. A crown of spikes resides on the back of the chair, their points looking considerably sharp. The man sitting on the chair only added to the intimidating factor.

	“All kneel for Lord Doran.” Everyone in the room kneels, besides Asher who does a polite upper body bow. Sydero mirrors Asher, bowing. Chris stands upright, refusing to bow or kneel.

“Ah, I suppose it only makes sense for Cimmerians to be in other countries as well.” I nod, hoping that would answer that. Asher could be an asset in helping us get out of here, but I doubt he would believe a word I tell him. It was similar to telling someone in my world that supernatural creatures were real.

“Or you can rely on me to help you get out,” I hear the Entity whisper gently, as if literally right at my side.

	Sydero notices this as well, clearing her throat. “The Alyrians in question were royal soldiers, escorting a caravan holding the heir to the throne. Something about peace talks with distant lands.”

	This seems to pique his interest, and he smiles ruefully, “then perhaps I have misjudged both of you.”

	“My Lord, if I may be so bold,” I start and his eyes land on me, narrowing but allowing me to continue, “we are excellent trackers that have been away this entire time.

“What are you thinking?”

“About what Lord Doran said, it seems like a coincidence. We show up just when this witch appears to tell him some future that concerns two Alyrians ruining him?” She quiets down as Asher passes us, raising a brow at our halted figures. “Asher, did you see this witch?” she asks, and he shakes his head.

“Doran spoke to her in confidence.”

“And you let him? Without any guards to keep an eye on her?” I question, taken aback when Asher chuckles.

&lt;&lt;if $nowbow&gt;&gt;\
	“Lord Doran can take care of himself, trust me.” He had a point, I haven’t finished the book, but so far, everyone was fearful of Doran, even the assassins. And if what he did to me was a simple exercise of his abilities, then I can only guess what his wrath would look like.

“Interesting,” Sydero chimes, trailing off as she gazes back towards the throne room, “This could be our witch. $name, you go and see if you can get any information from the citizens and find the witches. I’m going to talk to Doran, see if I can get him to tell me all about this secret meeting and what the witch looked like.” Before I can answer, she walks off, heading back towards the room with purpose. I gaze around the hallway, finding myself alone.
		
I walk through the streets of the Deadlands, curious at everything that I come across. From the weird plants to the even weirder animals that were on sale. Everything about this world was strange and exciting. Information that I wouldn’t gain by reading now rests at my fingertips. I walk up and down the black market, not buying anything more so due to my lack of currency, but I observe and sample everything that I can.

I’m standing in front of a shaggy goat when Asher approaches me.

“What are you doing? Why do you look as if you have never been to the market before?” I gaze over at him, thinking up a quick lie and failing.

“I was just admiring this goat.” Asher looks at the creature in front of me and then back to me.

“That’s a Giant Wooly-rat.”

“Wow, when you guys say giant, you really mean it,” I chuckle nervously, I wasn’t doing an excellent job at blending in.

Asher continues to stare at me with a blank face before saying, “that was a jest, that is a goat.” Asher grabs my bicep and yanks me away from the market, and then away from any listening ears. Once we’re a good enough distance away from everyone, he turns on his heel to face me.

“Who are you? Really. Are you a spy? Did the northern witches agree to make you look like us so you can infiltrate our ranks?” He was throwing out accusation left and right, but I stop listening after he mentions northern witches. Asher knew where they were then, though I doubt he would agree to help me without some kind of answer to his allegations.

“Okay,” I begin, motioning for him to shut up so that I can get my thoughts in order. How do you tell someone that their entire world is just a story and that you’re from another dimension entirely? This world doesn’t even have internet! It almost sounds like when Sydero informed me about the supernatural, I guess I could just copy her. As soon as the thought surfaces I’m against it. Probably not wise to call the guy an idiot and that he should’ve stayed out of your business because he won’t like the truth.

“This is going to sound crazy, but I’m not from here.”

“You are from Nidinia then, Caezios perhaps?”

“What? No. Your planet is called Jiwenia, mine isn’t. I live on a planet called Earth.” He stares at me, trying to wrap his mind around it. I choose to continue, knowing that leaving him with just that thought will make everything else harder. “In my world, yours is just in a story. I was reading about you and your world in a book. In my world, Alyrians, we’re everywhere along with animals and other creatures like werewolves.”
				
“Werewolves?”

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“Half human, half wolf. A witch from my world is mad at my friends and me for killing her family, and so she sent us here to try and kill us I guess.”
				
	“Your ... friends?”
				
	“Yea, the girl you met, Sydero. And the Alyrian that you think is a spy, Chris, he’s my friend too and wouldn’t hurt a fly. Well, that’s a lie, but he’s not here to kill or overthrow anyone.” Asher is quiet, and I can only imagine what’s going through his head. He walks ahead of me, and I follow behind him, staying quiet so that he can process everything.

“So, fate just chose you two is what you mean to say? Doran asks, unamused. Someone was apparently not a fan of fate. I don’t answer him, deciding that it was smarter to just stay quiet. We nod and bow, turning and leaving the great throne room and going back the way we came.

Thankfully, I did. Of course, there are no bars, but that’s not what was important. I call Asher to my side and show him all the things I can on the phone, bringing up my messages and games as well.

It takes about ten whole minutes just for Asher to tear his attention away from the phone, but he seems more than convinced that I’m not from here. His amazement is replaced by a stricken look.

“So, will you help me?” I finally ask. Asher looks around, his gaze going to the castle that stands in the distance.

“Lord Doran once asked you and your partner to go and kill a mother and child. You refused, and when Doran offered you a second chance, you refused again. He let them go, but you were punished, Doran used his powers on you to teach you a lesson.” It was minor I suppose, but the only thing that has already happened and wasn’t public knowledge. And by the way Asher is staring at me, I assume that I am right. His eyes widen, and he nods, seeming to be convinced since I couldn’t possibly know such a thing. A stricken look appears on his face.

“In your world, my world is but a book? A story to be passed on?”
						
“Yea. But obviously your world is more than that, I mean, here I am. It’s just a whole other dimension or something.”

“Would I be able to read about your world in a book?” I can’t tell if he asks me out of anger or genuine curiosity.

“Perhaps. Maybe in the Alyrian kingdoms though.” I chuckle at the thought, and he nods.

“You read about me then? What did you think of me?”

[[“You’re a loyal friend, as far as I can see.”]]
[[“You’re afraid of Doran, why?”]]
[[“You’re proud to be a Cimmerian, you don’t actually hate Alyrians, do you?”]]

You and your partner, the blood assassin, you have each other’s backs.”
								
“Or, at least we attempt to. There are times where I stand alone, and I fear more trials will await us in the future.” He has no idea. I want to tell him about those trials that obviously hadn’t happened yet, but I have no idea if that would mess up this world, and mine. It was better to leave the contents of the story in my world.

“So, will you help me?” I finally ask. Asher looks around, his gaze going to the castle that stands in the distance.

“You have yet to see Doran’s true abilities. They are not to be trifled with. Even I have not seen the full extent. And his behavior makes him unpredictable. I can see that even I, as an assassin, am expendable. That is why I fear him.”

“I do not know if I do or not,” Asher tells me with an embarrassed smile, “they murdered my people and forced us off of land that was ours in the process. But I suppose we can not blame them for what has become of our surroundings. I believe our people are as extraordinary as any other, and I wish to show this to others.”

I blush, scratching the back of my head as I fight to get the words out, “I thought ... well I thought you were um ... attractive.” Asher’s eyes widen in shock, but it doesn’t last long, a broad smile appearing as he turns to me entirely.

“I have been known to woo a few in my day,” he tells me, and I laugh, ignoring his lingering gaze.

I didn’t have time to stand here and tell him the truth, it would take too long, and he wouldn’t believe me either way. It would be similar to when I told Chris about the supernatural, only this was far more farfetched.
				
“The truth is, my partner and I have been undercover as Alyrians all this time, trying to discover their plans and then, catch that guy. Doran knows about it but he wants to keep the information confidential. Only us three knew what was going on.”
				
“And the witches I am suspecting?” Asher points out, motioning to me, “Alyrians would kill you on sight if they saw you. The witches must have put an illusion spell on you.” Agreeing would mean that I knew the witches and therefore didn’t really need his help. That, and when I did meet them then he would suspect they already knew me. Lying was such a chore.
				
[[“My friend is a witch. She did the illusions.”]]

I guess the truth in my words helps me sell it because Asher, though seems shocked, seems to accept it with a shrug.

“So, will you help me?” I finally ask. Asher looks around, his gaze going to the castle that stands in the distance.

The type not to care about another’s life, and if he did care, he cared long enough for them to be useful to him, and after that, his care vanished. It would seem that I’m not the only one who can see such thing happening. Asher seems to accept it, shrugging though I suppose saying he accepted it was a stretch. A look of distrust still rests in his eye.

	I follow behind Asher on horseback as he leads me down twisting and busy streets. Having never ridden a horse before, I was doing nothing more than just hanging on and hoping that the horse was trained enough to follow behind Asher.
	
	We go further to what I presume is the northern half of the Deadlands, journeying towards the mountains that were tall enough to have snow peaks but, from what my eyes could see, there was no such thing. The higher parts of the mountains are shrouded with clouds, making visibility impossible, even with eyes as good as the Cimmerians.

	“This place literally encompasses the aesthetic of Deadlands,” I chuckle, allowing my gaze to move across the dull surroundings. Even with the assortment of plants and trees, this place had an air of melancholy that went with it.
	
	“Any rules when messing with these witches?” I question Asher as soon as he dismounts in front of the mouth of a cave. Three orb shaped torches hang from the roof, and further in there are other torches meant to light up an otherwise dim path.

	“None that I can think of. They are nice, and though I have not dealt with them as much as others, I know that if anyone can help you, it is them.” I nod, and we walk further into the cave, Asher leading the way. The cave is hardly decorated, other than the few orbed shaped torches and what I assume are charms hanging from random jagged rocks.

	We’re deep within the cave when I begin to hear two voices chanting. Their voices sweet and harmonious, a gentle whisper in the air that beckons an individual to come closer. Though I suppose that’s what siren’s voices did as well. I exchange a nervous look with Asher who smiles softly, ushering me to continue following him.

	“And there we have it. I do believe we have outdone ourselves, sister,” I hear a sweet voice state. Asher leads me around a corner where two, almost identical, women stand. Between them rests a calm fire that spews white flames. A pot rests atop of the fire, inside is a clear liquid that doesn’t boil whatsoever. Instead, it shimmers, at moments reminding me almost like stars twinkling on the clearest of nights.
	
	“Lucia and Solania,” Asher greets, performing a respectful upper-body bow before resting his hand on my shoulder, “this is $name. $He has asked me to bring $him here to ask for your help.”

			I walk into the ballroom with Chris at my side, our eyes moving from one grand sight to the other. You see them in movies, read about them in books, but rarely do you ever see yourself actually going to one, not to mention a fantasy one. Hundreds of people mill about in their ballroom attire, socializing and dancing. Each individual holds themselves with grace and poise, something I can already tell will cause Chris and I not to fit in. The way they interact and lounge about, fitting into their roles perfectly, I wonder if they would’ve thrown a ball anyway, regardless if we had captured Sydero or not.

			The steward looks over at us and clears his throat, “Hunter Chris and $name.” The attendants of the ball applaud, and we continue making our way down the steps, behind us the steward calls out another name that was foreign to my ears.

			“So, what exactly is our angle here?” I ask Chris once we make it to the main floor, right as a woman approaches, grabbing Chris’s hand and yanking her to him.

			“Would you dance with me, good sir?” Before he can either say yes or no, she whisks him away. I watch with a light smile, before finding myself alone with no familiar faces. As Chris is asked by women after women for a dance, I head towards a table with a vast expanse of food on display.

			“Would you like me to make your plate?” Esther asks, suddenly appearing beside me.

			“That’s customary, huh?” I question, and she nods. Esther disappears for a moment before returning with a wooden plate, questioning me about my tastes as she begins to fill it.

			“Will you not dance?” she asks me, her eyes going to Chris, who was probably dancing with his fifth partner.

			“Perhaps,” I state, taking my eyes off of him and putting them back on what rested before me.

			“I don’t know how we’re supposed to do this without getting caught,” Chris tells me, staring at the building we were coming up on in fear.

			“We wing it, like always,” I snicker but he doesn’t seem convinced. I hear him grumble something as we continue on. “If anyone asks, we’ll say that we learned something new that might be useful and must question her. The entire capital knows about us, it shouldn’t be that hard.” Chris simply nods his head as we continue into the building, coming across our first guard.

			“Purpose, Hunters?” he asks, and I send Chris an, ‘I told you so,’ look.

			“We wish to question the creature. We think we might be able to get more information out of her based off of some things that we found out.” The guard immediately nods and lets us through, no questions asked, and probably no care given. As long as we were saying that we weren’t here to release her, I’m sure he didn’t care what we did.

			We head up a short staircase into a room that was lit mostly by torches hanging along the walls, as well as the corridors. The large room that we now found ourselves in had a long walkway, on both sides were stone cells.
		&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
			I approach the dungeon, the thought of being caught and what my cover would be, constantly coming to the forefront of my mind. I suppose I’ll just say that I learned something new that might be useful and must question Sydero, that seemed substantial enough.

	“I have not seen too many of you, but I am not complaining. I did not completely recognize your colors and wear. But who am I to turn down foreign help?

Instead, she spits at him, earning another hit from the guard whose horse she is tied to.

She was the expert on weird stuff, and she might have a better idea at what to do and what’s going on than us.

	I don’t move in to stop them for two good reasons. One, they had weapons, and I didn’t want to be at the end of them. And two, everything was happening too fast, I was still standing confused with Chris at my side. Sydero doesn’t go down easy though. She manages to give one guard a nasty scar before they are able to put chain links on her wrists.

	“Secure her to a horse,” the leader tells the guards, and the scratched guard slaps Sydero across the face.
		
	The man turns his attention to us, looking both Chris and me over curiously. Finally, a smile appears on his face, and he leans over in his saddle with an outstretched hand.
	
	“Good work soldiers, or well – what are you guys exactly?” I glance over at Chris who nudges me forward.
		
	I grab his hand and say, “bounty hunters, actually. Just doing our job.”
		
	“I have not seen too many of you, but I am not complaining. I did not completely recognize your colors and wear. But who am I to turn down foreign help? Especially when it comes to catching these creatures?” He looks back towards Sydero whose glaring at him, ready to tear his throat out. Instead, she spits at him, earning another hit from the guard whose horse she is tied to.
		
	“Rabid creatures I tell you,” he sighs, his attention back on us, “come, the King will want to hear about this, and perhaps even speak to you.” Neither Chris nor I was in the position to say no, that and they were going to take Sydero somewhere and we needed to know where. She was the expert on weird stuff, and she might have a better idea at what to do and what’s going on than us.
		
	We follow behind the mounted riders, happy that they were at least going at a slow pace for us to keep up with. As we walk behind them, Chris grabs my shoulder and pulls me back a few more steps.
		
	“Where the hell are we and what’s going on?”

	[[“That’s your new favorite question, huh?”]]

“I’m serious. I don’t like this.”
				
“What do you like?” I question, rolling my eyes at his behavior, “and what makes you think I know what’s going on?”

A few minutes later we leave the trail and the forest behind, walking onto a poor gravel road that goes past numerous of hastily built huts. Those that are out and about do themselves a favor and quickly disappear, and those who don’t hide don’t pay us a second glance. This was the rural part of whatever town we were approaching, but it was also made up by peasants and those who didn’t have the fortune to have their names remembered.

Further up the road, our surroundings change yet again. The huts turn into houses, each with a medieval Tudor feel to them. The road improves as well, done with more care than the path that we had traveled across before. Those walking around are more smartly dressed, and though they ignore us, it seems only because they have better things to concern themselves with. 

I can see a large splendid castle in the distance. It wasn’t exactly a fairytale castle, but I can’t help but think of such fantastical stories when I gaze at what I can. Upon getting closer, I’m able to judge it far better. The castle was made up by a multicolored stone that was all light shades of grey. Thick vines and foliage cover some parts of the castle, adding to the aesthetic. It’s the top of the castle that immediately makes me think of childish fairytales. Each tower’s roof was coned with a decorative flag waving from the top. The ramparts feature a soldier, and I can easily see the bows that sit on their backs.

“Come, come,” the leader beckons, grabbing Sydero’s chains harshly, pulling her behind him as if she was some disobedient puppy. Her eyes meet mine.

[[“I’ll lead the prisoner.”]]
[[Don&#39;t do anything.-&gt;FCDoNothing]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1134" name="“I’ll lead the prisoner.”" tags="" position="2135,4510" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;set $sydero +=2&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
“I’ll lead the prisoner,” I suddenly say, taking a step forward and grabbing the chain even though he hadn’t agreed yet. He releases it and looks to me for a reason. “She’s not your burden.” That’s all I say, but it seems to be enough. The leader nods and walks inside, the others following him.

I turn to look at Sydero who is still upset but seems to have relaxed.

“Surprised you haven’t killed the man yet,” I snicker from beside her, making sure my voice was low, so those ahead can’t hear me.

“Trust me, I’ve tried. I don’t have my abilities for some reason.”

“Oh, isn’t that grand,” I mumble and end our conversation there. The number of guards has increased, and I’m sure that if any of them see me talking to her, they’ll probably suspect something.

We walk into a crowded yet tastefully designed room, a throne resting at the end where a tall man stands beside it, chuckling with someone at his side. Sydero’s chains rattle, echoing through the room and grabbing everyone’s attention. The room descends into silence as we march forward, the King’s focus on us.

“King Barda,” the man says, doing an extravagant bow. The other guards bow as well before straightening. “I think you’ll be pleased with what we found.” All eyes fall on Sydero, the room guessing at what was found. If I had any doubts before, I knew for sure that this was my story. King Barda was a name that I had grown accustomed to seeing while reading. The story did a terrific job of describing him, he looked just like how the book said he would. But even with all of his grandness, it is easy to see the wickedness that rests in his eyes. It had the potential to grow, and only a bit of his honor kept it restrained.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“Is this?” King Barda asks, his eyes widening. I exchange a nervous glance with Chris. Why did it sound like they were all expecting her?
	
	“We believe so your majesty, and if she is who we have been forewarned about, then her aid might cripple the entire savage system.”
		
	“For pity sake, call them Cimmerians,” the man the king had been speaking to earlier states, “they have a functioning government. Don’t call them such simply because of past actions.” I hear whispering from those scattered across the throne room, it would seem that the man held an opinion that many didn’t share.
		
	“Give her a cell. We will let Ivan get the information we need out of her.” The guards nod and lead Sydero away. She doesn’t fight them this time, merely following them out. Chris and I remain, standing awkwardly beside the leader. He clears his throat and motions to the two of us.
	
	“And I would like to introduce to you the two hunters who are responsible for her capture.”
		
	“Hmm, bounty hunters,” he mumbles, scratching his beard, “and what do you want in return for your services.”
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“Is this?” King Barda asks, his eyes widening. I exchange a nervous glance with Sydero, who of course doesn’t catch it. Her attention was on the King, and only him. Why did it sound like they were all expecting her?

	“Of course,” he grumbles but seems pleased nevertheless, “in the meantime, you two must be tired. Lieutenant Kenan will direct you to a local inn to rest your head. Or at least direct you to a servant that will aid you.” Lieutenant Kenan does a deep bow before turning to us, ushering us out.

She also said that her presence would cause a string of unfortunate events to occur, rendering the kingdom weak and open to invasion. The only way to make sure it never comes to past was to kill her.”

		“Wait! When?” Esther shrugs at Chris’s question.

		“I do not know. Lieutenant Kenan will want to torture her first, to get as much information out of her as he can. Her execution will probably be tomorrow or the day after.” 

		“Your destination has been reached,” the driver calls out, bringing the horses to a stop. I look out the carriage’s window at the large and immaculate inn before me. It was even better than someone in my world.

		“What are we supposed to do? The only thing we know is that we’re inside some book!” Chris reminds me, pacing back and forth the long width of the room. I had expected to be guided to a one-bedroom, but two large beds rest on opposite ends of the room. A chest lays at the end of both beds, and besides a large wardrobe, a table, a mirror, and a long fur rug nothing else resides in the room.

		“You have an idea in getting to her?”

		“Might take a lot of persuasion or something else but it’s the only thing we got. We also need to get a look at that prison if we want to somehow find a way to get her out.” Chris nods, taking a minute to finally look around the room. I watch as he tries to relax but is unable too, sitting on the edge of the bed, staring into the distance. Despite neither of us wanting to say anything to the other, the room suddenly seems to get congested and the silence that fills it is awkward.

	“I’m not from this world,” I begin, trying to figure out the best way to say it all, “I’m from a world named Earth, probably a different dimension entirely from this one. A witch there cursed my group and sent us here, and now we’re confused about how to get back to our world, and what might happen if we stay here for too long. I’ve come to you guys, hoping that you can help me return and give me more information, if that’s possible.”

	The two women are silent, both staring at me. It is Solania who breaks the quiet, clapping her hands in excitement.

	“I have always wondered about the possibility of other dimensions,” she tells me.

	Lucia nods, “indeed, but we are limited in our powers, and the Gods here quietly observe us more than interfere. We find what you have said most interesting.”

	“So, you can help me? Or at least tell me what’s going on?” I ask in excitement.

	“We cannot be completely positive, but I do believe we know a spell that might get you back to your own world,” Lucia wanders off, stopping at a shelf and peering through it. “Does Lord Doran know of this?” The question is directed towards Asher.

	He shakes his head, “the Great Lord has enough to worry his mind over. That, and I do not wish to see what his thoughts on $name’s situation would be.” The two witches nod in understanding.

	“As for your situation, I can only think of a few possibilities,” Solania begins to explain, “your bodies still exist in your dimension and death or time away from them will lead to an unconscious state or death. Or, your bodies are here and in your dimension, you have disappeared. This means death with either cause you to resurrect as a child of Jiwenia, or your death will simply be your death.” I think about her words, my stomach churning at the possibilities that she had given me. The resurrection wasn’t so bad, -

	Before I can think any further on the thought, a pain pulses through my head, reminding me of what lives there ... or what doesn’t. Asher rests a hand on my back, giving me a concerned look that I wave away, giving him a small smile.

	Lucia comes back with a book, tapping her chin in thought. “The spell is do-able, but we will need the blood from the witch that sent you here. And it might not work since we don’t have a connection with your world.”

	“My friend is a witch, could she do the spell?” Both women perk up at that.

	“Indeed. In fact, this will be much easier if she completes it. Do send her to us, we would love to speak to her about the magic of your world.” I attempt to conjure up an image of Sydero answering the questions of these two women and fail. But I nod anyway, thanking them but stopping before I leave.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	I look over at Asher, giving him a small smile that I hope was genuine enough to not raise concern. He notices and apologizes, excusing himself and telling me that he’ll wait for me at the mouth of the cave. I thought I would have to do more explaining, but it would seem that people in this world were just more considerate.

	As soon as he leaves, the two women hit me with suspicious looks, both interested in why I had sent Asher away.

	“When telling him about my true purpose, I might have left some things out.”

	“And why would you do that?” the one I believe is Lucia asks, plopping something into the cauldron. Her sister claps her hands and throws something else into it that makes the water produce a low popping sound.

	“I doubt he’ll believe me, and I don’t have time to persuade him.” They don’t say anything, only motioning for me to continue on.

	“I’m not from this world,” I begin, trying to figure out the best way to say it all, “I’m from a world named Earth, probably a different dimension entirely from this one. A witch there cursed my group and sent us here, and now we’re confused about how to get back to our world, and what might happen if we stay here for too long. I’ve come to you guys, hoping that you can help me return and give me more information, if that’s possible.”

	The two women are silent, both staring at me. It is Solania who breaks the quiet, clapping her hands in excitement.

	“I have always wondered about the possibility of other dimensions,” she tells me.

	Lucia nods, “indeed, but we are limited in our powers, and the Gods here quietly observe us more than interfere. We find what you have said most interesting.”

	“So, you can help me? Or at least tell me what’s going on?” I ask in excitement.

	“We cannot be completely positive, but I do believe we know a spell that might get you back to your own time,” Lucia wanders off, stopping at a shelf and peering through it.

	“As for your situation, I can only think of a few possibilities,” Solania begins to explain, “your bodies still exist in your dimension and death or time away from them will lead to an unconscious state or death. Or your bodies are here, and, in your dimension, you have disappeared. This means death with either cause you to resurrect as a child of Jiwenia, or your death will simply be your death.” I think about her words, my stomach churning at the possibilities that she had given me. The resurrection wasn’t so bad, - 

	Before I can think any further on the thought, a pain pulses through my head, reminding me of what lives there ... or what doesn’t. 

	The witches don’t seem to have noticed, Lucia comes back with a book, tapping her chin in thought. “The spell is do-able, but we will need the blood from the witch that sent you here. And it might not work since we don’t have a connection with your world.”

Asher was here and sending him away would cause to much suspicion. That and I had a feeling that these witches wouldn’t believe me any more than Asher would.

“A witch has cursed my group, and I’m trying to figure out where she could be,” I begin, trying to figure out the best way to say it without giving away my true origins, “I’ve come to you, hoping that you can help me find this witch.”

“A simple location spell then,” the one I believe to be Solania, asks and I nod.

Lucia nods next, “a simple enough spell, one that we can have prepared for you by tonight. Though we do require payment.”

Asher rests a hand on my shoulder and speaks to the witches, “I will pay you for your troubles. We can speak about the payment later.” They nod, and Lucia goes to grab a book, flipping through it. Asher motions for me to follow him out but a thought occurs to me.

[[Continue-&gt;FC2_1]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1145" name="FC2_1" tags="" position="2658,4398" size="100,100">“Something else?” Solania sings. The Entity comes to mind and every mysterious secret that surrounds them. Maybe, just maybe, I could get answers.

“This might sound weird, but I have a voice in my head,” I begin, waiting to see their reaction. Their faces stay neutral, and I suddenly wish Sydero was more like this, willing to listen to even the craziest things. “I don’t know their origins or if this is just my mind playing tricks on me. Is there a way for you to find out?”

Solania looks to Lucia, who looks to the book in her hands, flipping between pages before nodding.

“We can prepare a spell for you. Return tonight, and we shall give you the answers you wish.” I nod and thank them, leaving the cave feeling a bit more hopeful about our predicament.


&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	Once back in the central area of the Deadlands, I focus in on the area that was meant to act as the ground’s gallows. Chris would be there, and I needed to update him and see if he was at least okay. As I make my way in that direction, I seem to forget the lingering shadow. Asher is hot on my heels, only reminding me of his presence when he asks me why I’m heading towards the prison.
	
	&lt;&lt;if $truth&gt;&gt;\

	Once back in the central area of the Deadlands, Asher wants to check in with Doran, as well as being curious about whatever Sydero was supposedly doing. I agree, wanting to know if whatever she was doing was actually helping us get out of there. When we enter, Sydero is leaning up against a wall, watching as Doran hits a man upside the head in anger.
	
	Asher leaves my side, turning into a shadow and gliding over to the others to calm everyone down, everyone but Doran. I notice that he makes sure not to get in the Lord’s way, instead he puts his attention on everyone else.
	
	“What happened,” I question Sydero who smirks.

And to check up on him, knowing him he’s panicking and making your guards want to kill him faster.” Asher chuckles and nods as he walks past me and towards the first guard. The guard automatically lets him pass, though I notice the look that he sends Asher once he can no longer see him.

The staircase down is dark, not a torch in sight. Yet, here I was, able to spot every step and even notice some of the small dust particles that lazily float by. I eye the grime on the wall and struggle to figure out whether that grime was blood or simply dirt.

As we get deeper, a foul metallic stench invades my nose. It doesn’t take me long to guess that it’s probably old dried up blood that was never cleaned, though I suppose in this world one can only be so sanitary. At the bottom of the stairs Asher approaches a few of the guards and I watch as they excuse themselves, heading back up the stairs in which we had just descended.

“What was that?”

“I told them that they are needed by the prison captain, you have only so many minutes to talk to the prisoner,” Asher tells me, starting towards the stairs but I stop him.

“Wait, why did you do that though? Could you not just tell them that I need to talk to him?”

“They would report it to Doran, and –” he begins but seems to hesitate, “my authority only goes so far.” I release him and he continues up the stairs, giving me a handful of minutes to speak to Chris. I would need to hurry indeed. Fighting past the stench, I search the cells for him. I’m surprised to find that the cells are actually clean with semi-comfortable looking bedding. I was expecting to see rats and bones and other things in each.

I finally find Chris in the second to last cell, staring up at the ceiling from his mat.

“Chris?” I question in a hush voice, though I’m wondering why I’m speaking quietly. //Cimmerians have good hearing//, I remind myself.

“$name? Is that you?”

“Yea, you can’t tell?”

“Well let’s see, it’s pitch black in here, so dark that my eyes can’t even adjust. So yea, I’m having a problem with telling.” He still has a snarky tone to his voice, a tone that makes me immediately roll my eyes.

“Are you still upset about the witch thing? About me not helping you? Get over yourself, we have bigger issues.”

“You’re a bigger issue,” Chris grumbles but I hear him loud and clear, ignoring him.

“I came down here to update you on what’s going on. Long explanation short, don’t die and we have to find the witch who did the spell to get out of here.”

“Well it’s not like I can help much. As you can see,” I watch as he spreads his arms out, motioning to his surroundings, “I’m stuck.”

[[“You’ll be out in a little while.”]]

“Yea, like that&#39;s a big improvement,” I hear him grumble yet again. I’m ready to question his grumble this time but stop when I hear someone approach. Asher peeks his head in and motions me over, a sign that our time was over. I give Chris one last look, though he still stares at the ceiling, and then leave.

We leave the gallows behind and head back to the castle, Asher wanting to check in with Doran, as well as being curious about whatever Sydero was supposedly doing.

“You don’t think that’s dangerous? Doran might like you but you’re bringing attention to us still.”

Sydero shrugs, “it’s fun.” To back up her words, a large smile flashes onto her face as he yells at another of his generals.

She turns to look at me, “I also got him to send out riders to look for this witch. I said that the witch needed to be questioned further, to make sure all fortunes smile in his favor. What did you learn?”

&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\

	“I think I’m going to stick around for a bit longer. If only to see how powerful he really is.” The smirk on her face is unsettling, but I know it all too real. I’ve seen it countless times, used on me most often than not. I clear my throat, but her eyes are still on Doran, the best way I can describe the look is that she is observing him, sizing him up.

	“You’re interested?” I ask, trying my best to not sound upset, “in him?”

	“I’m interested in powerful people, simple as that.”

	&quot;I&#39;m interested in powerful people, simple as that.&quot;

	She turns to me with a devilish smirk, &quot;it&#39;s fun to see what can bring powerful people down to their knees.&quot; Her eyes go back to Doran, relaxing her stance on the wall but not moving.

	&quot;Well, have fun with that. I&#39;m going to go speak with the witches again.&quot; She nods, and I go, leaving her and the castle behind.

“Roe? Are you jealous of Doran?”

“Hell no,” I growl, crossing my arms but then stopping, realizing that I was almost pouting. Sydero’s finger touches my chin, her nail digging into my skin as she forces my gaze up to meet hers.

“Aw, Roe, you should know by now that no one interests me more than you,” she removes her finger and goes back to her previous stance of propping herself up on the wall, “but, I need a break from figuring you out sometime.”

The Deadlands themselves weren’t cold but pushing further into the mountains was a different story. Interesting enough, I was cold, yet I also felt empowered, as if the lack of light was making me feel even more inhuman than I already was.

I dismount and tie my horse up loosely to a nearby tree, shouting my presence to not shock the witches. I was surprised that I was able to find this place without Asher’s guidance again, guess I paid more attention than I presumed I did the first time up here.

I step into the area that I had found the witches last time, shocked when I see that the small hole in the cave was no longer small, nor a hole. The cave opens up into an extremely large opening in the mountain. Two large huts sit on opposite ends of the clearing, facing one another. In the middle is a large cauldron that sits still, and behind that, further to the back is an actual dragon. The dragon looks mighty, perched upon a rock and watching me closely. I get closer, but it doesn’t attack, it just follows me.

“Ah, our friend from earlier, welcome back,” Solania shouts from her hut, clapping and approaching me.

“What happened to the small hole you were in last time?” I question.

“Sweetheart, did you forget that fast?” she questions, “we are illusion witches. That whole room was but an illusion, we do not like meeting with others without a meeting.” I nod in understanding as Lucia comes out, her arms full of ingredients.

“Do you mind helping, dear sister?” Solania chuckles softly and snaps her fingers, a doppelganger appears and rushes over to Lucia’s side, grabbing some of the materials as they both walk to the cauldron.
&lt;&lt;if $sumitup&gt;&gt;\
	
	“Here is the location that we promised you. Make sure you do it and then immediately seek the witch out, it is only accurate in the moment.” I nod and thank them both as I take the paper from Lucia.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“Now, for your friend,” Solania tries, getting the dragon’s attention. The dragon doesn’t leave its spot, but it does shoot a fireball to the cauldron. The cauldron lights up with life, blue and white flame licking the sides of the large pot, calming down slowly.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1156" name="Ask them more about the spell." tags="" position="3146,4511" size="100,100">“So, what exactly can you tell me about the spell?” I question, walking closer to look inside the now glimmering cauldron. The colors inside shift from one shade of orange to another, never staying one hue for long.

“If you are worried about your health, do not fret, this will do nothing but give us a look into your mind. To walk areas that are not usually walked,” Solania answers.

“The spell will take us, and you, into your mind. There, we will be able to meet this friend of yours and with our abilities, hopefully, grant you the answers you seek.” I nod and let them continue preparation. I take a seat on the fur mats, and they instruct me to try and fall asleep. 

The ambiance is the crackling of the fire and the deep breaths of the dragon. Solania and Lucia don’t speak, or it might be that I just don’t hear them.

In little to no time, I’m fast asleep.

“No, simply sit and clear your mind. Think of nothing,” Solania tells me.

“In other words, try to fall asleep,” Lucia adds. I nod and take a seat on one of the fur mats that is lying nearby.

I open my eyes on a world that I have seen a couple of times. The grayscale space shrouded in fog. I yell out but realize that I have my voice. I can move without complication, and when I turn around, I spot the two witches. The two of them stare at the world, and I can practically feel their uncomfortableness.

“What lies here is a very malicious being,” Lucia begins, walking to my side, “this world, this part of your mind, it is filled with horror and malevolence.”

“Trust me, I know,” I tell them motioning for them to follow me. The more we walk, the more I’m able to see what really surrounds me. I soon determine that we’re on a road, an oddly familiar road. Four paths rest before me, one heading to the [[right]], another going [[straight]], the third leading off into the fog going [[left]], and the last rests [[behind]] us.

&lt;&lt;set $visit = true&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
I head to the right, walking past hills and trees until I get to a building. My old schoolhouse, I realize. The building held a few unhappy memories, mainly because it was the reason for me having to wake up at irregular hours and then focus for far too long. But it wasn&#39;t the worst school. No, compared to high school, this place was paradise.

&quot;What is this building?&quot; Lucia questions, coming up to stand beside me.

&quot;A schoolhouse, do you not have them in the Deadlands?&quot; I ask, and they both nod their heads.

&quot;We do, but they don&#39;t look like this. They are simple buildings, this looks large enough to house countless families.&quot; I nod in understanding, that&#39;s what most of the schools looked like, but that was possibly due to the larger population of my world.

&quot;Do you sense anything here?&quot; I ask them, and Solania shakes her head. Seeing there was nothing left here but memories I&#39;d rather leave undisturbed, I turn and head back.

&lt;&lt;return&gt;&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1160" name="straight" tags="" position="3094,4721" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;set $visit = true&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
I take one step forward, and then another. Each action brings up an irrelevant memory that I can’t dare touch. It runs away like a child, wishing for me to chase after it and staying just away from my fingertips.

The fog slowly rolls by, revealing a large suburban house that I haven’t seen for many years. The house isn’t exactly what I remember it as. Firstly, it was never this eerie. The house was always dark blue and brown. I remember mother had a bird fountain in the front and some wind chimes on both sides of the door. The house always carried a lively spirit, especially in summer and autumn.

“Does this home hold significance to you?” I hear Lucia ask and see her walking off to the side.

“Yea, this was my childhood home. My parent’s home.”

“I sense death,” Solania says in disgust, “the air is thick with it and the foul stench of evil.”

“My parents died, the home was never the same after.” With my words, the house begins to crumble until nothing stands there anymore, nothing but burnt heaps of debris. I turn, leaving the scene behind.

&lt;&lt;return&gt;&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1161" name="left" tags="" position="3197,4719" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;set $visit = true&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
I lead myself and the two ladies to the left, walking down a winding road until we get to a large white and blue building. I’m unsure what this building has to do with my memories and this journey until the building disappears, leaving a single room behind. We wander closer and find two civilians inside, alongside them is a doctor and two nurses.

“That was a miracle birth,” one of the doctors say, pressing a dry rag to his head, collecting the specks of sweat there.

“I thought the mother wouldn’t make it,” a nurse inputs, clutching the clipboard in her hands tightly against her chest. I look over at the couple, the father kissing the mother’s head multiple times. The mother clutches the baby close to her chest, tears intermingling with beads of sweat. This was, me?

I’m about to wander closer, to get a better look, when an unsettling presence feels like it has perched itself on my shoulders. I look around, just in time to see an eerie black mist approaching. My eyes widen as the figure rests its hand on top of the child’s head.

The scene vanishes.

“What just happened?” I ask the two witches who are both looking forward, at where the scene once laid.

“I do not know, but … did you feel that?” Solania asks her sister, and she nods slowly.

“I do not wish to speak on it yet, I wish to gather further evidence of my thoughts.” The two of them nod before ushering me to once again lead them.

&lt;&lt;return&gt;&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1162" name="FC2_4" tags="" position="3256,4399" size="100,100">We continue on, the witches taking the lead as I follow behind them absentmindedly. Each step gets heavier, and I feel massive weights rest themselves on my shoulder. I yawn loudly, stopping when I see that my breath is a black mist.

“Uh, guys?” I question, breathing out again so they could see.

“Hmm, your assumptions were right sister,” Solania says, spinning her finger just beneath the black mist. The mist looks like it’s being sucked into a tornado as it wraps around Solania’s finger. “This creature is nothing like we have ever seen. But tell me, is the presence the same?”

“No, I recognized two extremely different ones. One thing is for sure,” Lucia says and looks at me, “the creature is not your imagination. It is here and as long as you breathe, so does it.”

[[“So, this isn’t my imagination?!”]]
[[“Are you saying I can’t get rid of them?”]]
[[“So, my past?”]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1163" name="behind" tags="" position="2882,4719" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;set $visit = true&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
I turn and take the path resting behind us, leading them further into the fog. They don&#39;t question, and at some points, I forget that the witches are even there. They are here to observe and sense, and then later tell me what is going on.

I come to a stop, my eyes falling on a playground. I remember this playground, barely, but the memory rubs against my mind, always just barely out of reach. I take a step closer, and the fog vanishes. The playground is still dreary appearing, that doesn&#39;t change, but I now watch as a group of children run by. They run through daffodils and dandelions, trampling them in fits of laughter as they chase one another.

But there is one who sits, unbeknownst of those nearby, on the swing set. Beside the small figure is a darker one, appearing like a black ghost with two deep and innocent eyes.

&quot;You see them too?&quot; I question the witches, and they both murmur a low yes. We approach them but the duo &#39;doesn&#39;t seem to notice us, they continue their conversation that is now audible.

&quot;I don&#39;t understand,&quot; little me says, kicking up dirt with the toe of $his foot.

&quot;Mom hated when I did that,&quot; I find myself smiling, &quot;it messed up the shoe and just made it dirty.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t need to understand,&quot; the figure growls but quickly stops, taking a deep breath and slapping on a childish grin, &quot;you &#39;don&#39;t have to worry about anything little friend. I&#39;m going to take care of everything.&quot;

Little $name shakes $his head, turning to who $he thought was $his friend, &quot;so all I have to do is, let it happen?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; the dark figure says happily, &quot;just let everything happen. It&#39;ll all be okay, trust me.&quot;&quot;

&quot;But what&#39;s gonna happen?&quot;

The figure doesn&#39;t immediately answer, resting a smoky tendril on $his lap. For a figure with only so many expressions, they sure were pulling off sympathy well. &quot;Your destiny. What you were made for, what only you can do.&quot; Little $name puffs out $his cheek but nods.

[[Interrupt them.]]
[[Stay back.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1164" name="Interrupt them." tags="" position="2916,4831" size="100,100">I surge forward, angrily approaching them.

&lt;&lt;if $darktruth&gt;&gt;\
	“No, $name! Don’t listen to them, they aren’t your friend. They are everything but that.” Suddenly the black figure’s eyes go red, and it attacks Little $name. It goes straight for their cheek, swiping their tendril across $his cheek. $He, no I, scream out as the side of my cheek flares up in pain. It drags me to the ground, and when I open my eyes, I’m surrounded by darkness, falling further and further.
&lt;&lt;elseif $darkburns&gt;&gt;\
	“No, $name! Don’t listen to them, they aren’t your friend. They are everything but that.” Suddenly the black figure’s eyes go red, and it attacks Little $name. It goes straight for their arms, grabbing both of them and refusing to let go as the figure stares Little $name down. $He, no I, scream out as both arms flare up in pain. It drags me to the ground, and when I open my eyes, I’m surrounded by darkness, falling further and further.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“No, $name! Don’t listen to them, they aren’t your friend. They are everything but that.” Suddenly the black figure’s eyes go red, and it attacks Little $name. It goes straight for their chest, jumping on top of Little $name and constantly striking the heart. $He, no I, scream out as my heart flares up in pain. It drags me to the ground, and when I open my eyes, I’m surrounded by darkness, falling further and further.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“It was always meant to be,” a new voice adds in, caressing my pained cheek. Before I can get too far, I’m suddenly shot back to the grayscale world. Fog again surrounds us, and the two witches kneel beside me, worry on their face.

“Are you alright?” Solania questions and I nod, feeling something in my hand. I open it and see a dandelion there, not yet ruined. I raise it, and it blows away, but the memory stays.

But the Entity made it seem like something big was supposed to happen, something that I doubt actually did.

I suddenly feel something in my hand and open a hand that I didn’t know was closed. I open it and see a dandelion there, not yet ruined. I raise it, and it blows away, but the memory stays.

“So, this isn’t my imagination? Everything is real?”

“Indeed,” Lucia tells me, “so much is still unknown, and most of that is due to us not being of your world. Lucia tells me, each word making me shiver profusely. She snaps her fingers and I’m back in the mountains, trying to think over her words.

“You speak of this creature as if it is only one being. It is not.” I stop at that, what could they possibly mean. That the Entity was two beings in one, two different buildings altogether?

“What do you mean?”

“As soon as we arrived in your mind,” Solania begins, “we picked up on the malicious being’s presence. A presence so extreme that it caused the air to feel thick and toxic. This presence was powerful. And yet, during the scenes, there was a different presence altogether. This second one was weaker, hardly noticeable.”

“Are you saying that the presence with me now, is the stronger one?”

“Indeed. We would say that the two could be the same if not for the sudden power difference.” Great … but why didn’t the Entity tell me this? Why would they pretend to be the same creature? What was going on?

And like expected, the Entity was quiet.
&lt;&lt;if $sumitup&gt;&gt;\
	
	Something they said, about not being part of my world, suddenly strikes me and I give them a small smile.
	
	“Sorry, about not telling you the truth before. I just didn’t wish to sum all of that up.” Lucia doesn’t seem to mind, but Solania is the one to answer.

	“It bothers us not. We easily figured out that you were not telling us the entire story.”

	Lucia adds in, “we also did a spell to learn more about you. When it refused to show us anything, we could only estimate that you were not of this dimension. A theory that my sister and I have now proven true.” I nod and apologize once again.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

I thank both sisters for their help and then leave, thinking over everything that has happened. Despite the all of a sudden quiet Entity, I have almost no time to really think about what I learned, I just wanted to rest my head for the night.

“Wait, are you saying I can’t get rid of them?” I ask, panic in my voice.

I deliver the horse back to the hand I had borrowed him from and then set on my way to finding an inn or someplace similar. The feeling of walking through the night without any light source, yet not needing a light source at the same time, is unnatural and bugs me. A part of me desperately wants to walk up onto someone’s porch and just turn it on. I’m sure I would get used to this ability one day, though I doubt I would be here very long.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1170" name="FC2_6" tags="" position="3577,4399" size="100,100">I approach the guest houses that Asher had pointed out earlier to me, going inside to get a room. The first floor is nothing but a tavern, filled with random patrons and a large number of soldiers. They are all boisterous, and a few of them have definitely had one too many to drink. I approach the bartender when I spot Asher at the far end.

“A room please, Doran knows of my need for one,” I tell him before turning to speak to a quiet drinking Asher.

“A man like you drinks alone and quietly at a bar?” I question, sneering as I lean on the wooden surface beside him. He cracks a smile and shrugs his shoulder.

“Rarely. But I am rarely without my partner, the blood assassin. And guards do not look at me as a friend.”

“Yea, about that, what’s their problem with you?”

“If my partner were here then I would perhaps receive more respect. But because I am the most common assassin, only a step up from elites, many do not see the reason I am held higher than they. But many do not treat me unkindly. All Cimmerians have respect for one another, I have not yet seen one who has belittled another simply because they are not strong.” I nod, wondering how that dynamic would look like on Earth. If all humans treated each other with even the smallest bit of respect, simply because.

“Did you find the answers you seek?” Asher asks after a minute of silence. I nod, thinking about tomorrow and about the witch that we would need to locate.

“Speaking of answers, do you know where my friend is?” The last thing I remember was Sydero wishing to spend more time with Doran, for ... sexual reasons. Asher shakes his head, and I sigh glumly, not knowing or wanting, to find this woman.

“Both of you look too sad to be in a bar,” the bartender tells me, giving me a key and a drink with a slight smile. He nods to Asher before turning to other patrons. I notice Asher sit up, squaring his shoulders.

“He is right. We are among good company, yes?” Asher asks, raising his half-empty mug to me.

We laugh as we bang the mugs on the top of the bar, asking the bartender for more. He’s happy to oblige, especially since there’s coin in it. The night goes by, and I learn one important thing that night, Earth alcohol has nothing on Cimmerian ale.

I give him a gentle smile as I grab my own mug, clinking it with Asher’s and winking before drinking the contents inside.

“You’re far more than //just// good company,” I tell him.

“Then what kind of company am I?” he asks, leaning in with an interested smile.

“Hmm, once in a lifetime kind of company probably.” I shrug at the answer, but I can always just blame it on the buzz from the ale. This stuff was mighty strong, strong enough to probably even cause Sydero to pause.

“Then to once in a lifetime company. For it will be a shame when they depart,” he shouts, and we again clink our mug as the night rolls on.

I tell Asher that I was going to go for a walk before grabbing my mug and walking towards the gallows, seeing only one guard there. He nods his head at me, perhaps recognizing me from earlier, though I can’t say the same.

With permission to continue, I do so.

“Hey Chris, want something to drink?” I question, holding out the mug, but forgetting that he couldn’t see. I guide him to the mug and watch as he messily guzzles the entire thing down, handing it back to me.

“How the talk with the witches go?”

“How do you know about that?” I ask. I don’t recall telling him such thing, only that we needed to find the witch that sent us here in the first place. If anything, there were way too many witches in my life at this point in time.

“Sydero came by earlier to tell me what you had gone to do. So, she beat you to it.”

“What is up with this attitude of yours, huh?” I see him roll his eyes, but I refuse to leave it again. This was becoming outrageously annoying.

“Is me telling you what’s bothering me going to change anything? Change or situation or where I’m at?” he asks, knowing the answer but asking as if he was inquisitive.

“It will –”

“Yes or no question, $name.” I grind my teeth together as I barely say the word, no. With his answer received, he nods and returns to his mat, laying down with his back facing me. I could throw an attitude, but it would gain the attention of the other guards, and so I quietly leave.

When I arrive though, she is sitting on the steps to the castle, fiddling with a multi-colored rock.

&lt;&lt;if $locationspell&gt;&gt;\
	“Hey, here’s a location spell to find the witch.” I grab the parchment with the spell and hand it to her, still gazing at the shimmering rock in her hand. It begins to pulse when she looks away, gaining her attention once again.

	“What is that?”

	“Some kind of magic rock that the wielders here use to focus. It pulses when you drop your concentration.”

	“Must be easy for you,” I remark, saying this before noticing the sweat stuck to the side of her face.
	
	“Actually, it’s not. This place literally has magic in the air, it’s suffocating, almost like I have to learn how to breathe differently unless I want to blow up. You’d think that make concentrating and using my abilities easier, but I don’t know how to even begin processing this stuff.” She stuffs the rock into her pocket and then clears her throat, motioning for me to follow.

	“Now that we can find this bitch, we should be able to end all of this quickly.”

	I nod and add, “the witches said we need to be fast. The location spell is only accurate as soon as we do it. So, if she’s on the move, then we might lose her.”
	
	Sydero nods in understanding, looking the parchment over, “seems simple enough. Which means it’s going be hard as hell for me.” She sighs and then stands, “come on, and bring your friend.”

	“Asher?” Sydero nods as she heads towards the stables, and I go to search for Asher to bring him along.

	
	After Sydero finds the witches location, we immediately ride out with Asher as our guide. We go deeper into the Deadlands, riding the lizards into a more steppe environment.

	“Not really smart to hide out here, seeing that there’s a lack of places to hide,” I point out as we go. My eyes dart from one place to another, hoping to catch a glimpse of her or some makeshift shelter as we go.

	“I agree, but a witch can make do. I doubt that the creatures here will mess with someone who holds magic in their palm,” Asher tells me.

	“Still foolish,” Sydero grumbles. Asher turns to face us, a contemplating look on his face. We continue on in silence, each of us busy keeping our eyes out for movement.
	
	“Such a stupid plan,” I hear a voice speak, snickering to myself.

	“So now you wish to appear. After everything that has happened,” I growl.

	“I want answers, who are you?”
	
	“You have bigger issues, don’t you think? The potential you have to die here hasn’t escaped my notice. Give me control so I can get you out of this mess.” I chuckle, acting like I was sneezing when I realize that I had done so in front of the others. They continue to ignore me.
	
	“You must be crazy,” I remark but stop upon seeing a makeshift tent not too far off. I wave his existence away and focus in on the now.
	
	“Whoa,” I tell my Heilo Steppe Lizard, the others following my example.

	“What?” Sydero asks, and I point into the distance, the direction that the tent lies.

	“Unless random creatures can make a structure like that to spend the night,” I say to Asher who shakes his head.

	“So, what is the plan then? How do you plan on apprehending her?” Sydero gazes at me, silently asking me for my thoughts.
	
	[[Sneak and ambush.]]
	[[Have Asher go in first.]]

	“The riders that Doran sent out haven’t come back with anything helpful yet, meaning the bitch is still in the wind.” As she says this, she’s still gazing at the shimmering rock in her hand. It begins to pulse when she looks up at me, gaining her attention once again.

	“What is that?”

	“Some kind of magic rock that the wielders here use to focus. It pulses when you drop your concentration.”

	“Must be easy for you,” I remark, saying this before noticing the sweat stuck to the side of her face.

	“Actually, it’s not. This place literally has magic in the air, it’s suffocating, almost like I have to learn how to breathe differently unless I want to blow up. You’d think that make concentrating and using my abilities easier, but I don’t know how to even begin processing this stuff.” She stuffs the rock into her pocket and then clears her throat, motioning for me to follow.

	“So, back on the witch. How do we even know that she’s still on the same continent as us?” I question.

	“We don’t, but if she wants us dead, then the smartest thing for her would be to stay close. I say we ride around and act like we’re just as confused as we were yesterday. Maybe she’ll think we’ll be easy to pick off that way.”

If we announce that his execution is going to be tomorrow, then it might draw her here. Think about it, she told Doran that humans were going to pop up and ruin him. I don’t think she knows that we were turned into Cimmerians. If we can blend in, then jumping her would be the easy part.”

Sydero stops, stroking her chin slowly, “you would risk Chris’s life like that?” I bite the side of my cheek, knowing he wouldn’t be happy when he notices us not trying to stop them, and warning him beforehand will just piss him off more. And so, I nod.

Sydero nods, “then, I like the plan. But we’ll need an illusion, to make it also seem like we’re up there, or at least tell Doran to make an announcement that two other Alyrians are dying with him.”

&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
“I say we speak to Doran, it’s faster, and there’s no way we can’t fool her.” With our minds made up, Sydero and I head back to the castle and request an audience with Doran. Asher is in the throne room when we arrive, nodding at both of us as Doran sits on his throne. He listens to us, but he doesn’t seem happy.

“This lie seems unneeded; the witch will come.”

&lt;&lt;if $hair is &quot;bald&quot;&gt;&gt;\
	“It is less about the witch coming and –”

	“Again, why is this one speaking?” Doran questions, refusing to even look at me. The lack of hair on my head reminds me that I have no claim to speak, much less stand here.
&lt;&lt;elseif $nowbow&gt;&gt;\
	“It is less about the witch coming and –”

	“Insolent Cimmerians do not have a right to speak here,” Doran shouts, refusing to even look at me. I almost forgot about the disdain that he has for me since I refused to bow.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“It is less about the witch coming and more about the believability of the announcement,” I start.

	“And why would there be doubt in an announcement personally made by me?” Doran questions, his grip on the side of his throne tightening in annoyance and anger.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

Sydero holds her hand out and with a slight bow, takes a step closer. “My apologies, my Lord, but what my compatriot speaks is true. This witch is clever, clever enough to play you.” I think this will cause a rise in him, but Doran just continues to listen to her, though I see his eyes narrow at the reminder.

“If our sources prove true, she is searching for three Alyrians to die. If we give her three, then she will come. If we give her one, she may not care enough to leave the safety of her hideaway.” Doran watches Sydero and with a slight smile leans forward.

“I hear you,” he begins, and I see a dark, twisted gleam appear in his eyes, “but I still don’t see the reasoning to lie.” I growl, but Sydero is already on top of it.

“Then allow us to talk about this in length, in private company.” I raise a brow and gaze over at her, the same dark gleam in her eye as well. I was having trouble trying to figure out whose eyes held the most mysterious shimmer. Doran rises and agrees, commanding Sydero to follow.

She leans towards me, “make sure everything is ready for the execution. We only have one shot at this.” She gives me no time to argue or even stop her as she follows after Doran.

“Your friend,” Asher says, coming up to me, “she either has a death wish, or she is the bravest person I have ever spoken to.”

&lt;&lt;if $SRomance &gt;= 5&gt;&gt;\
	“A mix of both,” I mumble and look at where she disappeared, a pit opening in my stomach. If I had thought that anything could reside between Sydero and me, then she had just given me her answer.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“A mix of both,” I mumble and take one last look to where the duo disappeared. I turn with Asher at my side to do as she suggested, prepare.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
“We should speak to the witches,” I tell Sydero, knowing what their magic could do. Doran didn’t need to know more about our plan, I’d rather he didn’t as well.

“Fine, you go to them and tell them. I’ll go tell Doran to announce the execution.” I give her a look, and she chuckles, waving my warning look away.

“Someone must, and who better to do so, than me?”

“You only wish to have another go at him if you hadn’t already.”

“Oh I haven’t,” she sings as she goes back to the castle, leaving me standing there.

&lt;&lt;if $SRomance &gt;= 5&gt;&gt;\
	A pit opens in my stomach. If I had thought that anything could reside between Sydero and me, then she had just given me her answer.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	I take one last look at her retreating figure. Turning to go tell the witches our plan, and to hope that they could pull such trickery off.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

[[Execution Day-&gt;FC2_8]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1179" name="Agree to the plan." tags="" position="3802,4501" size="100,100">“Sounds like a plan, and the only thing that we have at the moment that doesn’t put one of us in extreme danger.”

“Going up against the witch is extremely dangerous,” Sydero points out.

“True, but at least we know she’ll be coming for us.”

“Yes, because that just sounds so wonderful. Come on, and bring your friend.”

“Asher?” Sydero nods as she heads towards the stables, and I go to search for Asher to bring him along.

&lt;&lt;if $locationspell&gt;&gt;\
	After Sydero finds the witches location, we immediately ride out with Asher as our guide. We go deeper into the Deadlands, riding the lizards into a more steppe environment.

	“Not really smart to hide out here, seeing that there’s a lack of places to hide,” I point out as we go. My eyes dart from one place to another, hoping to catch a glimpse of her or some makeshift shelter as we go.

	“I agree, but a witch can make do. I doubt that the creatures here will mess with someone who holds magic in their palm,” Asher tells me.

	“Still foolish,” Sydero grumbles. Asher turns to face us, a contemplating look on his face. We continue on in silence, each of us busy keeping our eyes out for movement.
	
	“Such a stupid plan,” I hear a voice speak, snickering to myself.
	
	“So now you wish to appear. After everything that has happened,” I growl.
	
	His voice feigns hurt, “I thought you would appreciate me standing out your little discovery session.”
	
	“I want answers, who are you?”
	
	“You have bigger issues, don’t you think? The potential you have to die here hasn’t escaped my notice. Give me control so I can get you out of this mess.” I chuckle, acting like I was sneezing when I realize that I had done so in front of the others. They continue to ignore me.

	“So, what is the plan then? How do you plan on apprehending her?” Sydero gazes at me, silently asking me for my thoughts.
	
	[[Sneak and ambush.]]
	[[Have Asher go in first.]]
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	With Asher with us, the three of us ride out on the lizards, searching far and wide for the witch. We check the less populated areas at first, and as our search begins to turn up nothing, we then turn our focus to the steppe.

	The Deadlands, though embodying the name in every way it could, still held a subtle beauty about it. The grayscale tones of the world were offset by the bright neon colors that some of the fauna held. Adding to that was how each flower held a different shape and appearance, rarely ever resembling that of their neighbor. Any a place as flat as the steppe held wonder, and further into the distance, mountains that one could only hope to reach.

	“Someone needs to focus,” I hear that voice coo as if I was a little kid who needed a different kind of scolding.

	I chuckle to myself, “now you want to show up, huh? How about earlier? When everything was happening. I would’ve thought you would come to defend yourself.”

	“Defend myself against what? Witches reminding me of how powerful I am? No, I basked in everything. But that is beside the point, your search isn’t going to turn up anything, you need my help.”

	“I don’t know where you got that thought from, but I don’t.”

	“Hmm, I think you do. In fact, you //want// my help. The power that I can send coursing through your veins. Come, tell me you don’t want a taste.”

	“I don’t want what you’re selling,” I scoff, silence following my thought.

	“That witch is possessed by a demon, and your dear Sydero has yet to learn how to use her abilities here. What weapon do you have on you besides a puny blade?” I freeze up but continue to pay them no mind. They had a point though. My eyes travel to Sydero who had a dagger only inches longer than my own.

	“You’ll be the savior of the day. Or do you wish to once again be saved by her?”

	“Whatever you’re trying to do, it won’t work.” I shut them up, doing everything I can to block their voice.

	“Hey,” Sydero states, nodding to something in the distance, I can barely make out a poorly done tent, resting oddly against the steppe’s background.

	“What is our plan?” Asher questions.
	
	[[Sneak and ambush.]]
	[[Have Asher go in first.]]

	In the end, Doran agrees to push Chris’s execution forward, and the witches agree and confirm that they can set up two more illusions to make it seem like Chris isn’t the only one being executed that day. 
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	In the end, Doran agrees to push Chris’s execution forward and to announce that two more will be joining him. Which only makes me wonder what Sydero had to do to persuade him.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

I stand beside Asher, watching as the crowds gather around the execution platform, murmuring about the news that had brought Cimmerians from far and wide.

“See the witch anywhere?” I ask Asher, and he shakes his head.

“I will tell you when I do, she had an unforgettable appearance.”

&lt;&lt;if $int is &quot;men&quot; or $int is &quot;both&quot;&gt;&gt;\
[[“Unforgettable, huh?”]]

&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
“Unforgettable, huh?” I ask with a small smile, looking towards Asher who returns the smile.

“Perhaps unforgettable is too strong a word. Your appearance is unforgettable, hers was simply odd.”

“Now you’re just trying to save face,” I laugh but Asher doesn’t join in, shooting me a soft smile.

“I am simply delivering a truthful compliment, to someone who truly deserves it.” I bite my cheek and drop his gaze, perking up when I hear someone shouting to be let go.

&lt;&lt;if $chrisbait_doran&gt;&gt;\
	The voice can only belong to Chris, and when I look in his direction, I see him being led out. No chains decorate his wrists or ankles, the only guard nearby is that who guides him.

	“You guys must be certain that he won’t escape?” I ask Asher, and he shrugs.

	“Many of those who are executed are not dumb enough to try. They will simply see death quicker, not to say that some do not attempt.” Chris fights with all of his strength, which isn’t much compared to the Cimmerian guard that drags him onto the platform. A man in dark golden silk garb stands at the end, clearing his throat as he speaks about Chris’s crime. This was the moment of truth.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	The voice can only belong to Chris, and when I look in the direction, I see him being led out. No chains decorate his wrists or ankles, the only guard nearby is that who guides him. Behind him are two more Alyrians that look similar to Sydero and I, but don’t quite look like our human forms. I suppose the witches could only do so much, never having seen our human forms before. They don’t make as much commotion as Chris, but they do fidget and gaze around in fear.
	
	“Hopefully this works?” I say to Asher and he nods once. Chris fights with all of his strength, which isn’t much compared to the Cimmerian guard that drags him onto the platform. A man in silk garb stands at the end, clearing his throat as he speaks about Chris’s crime. This was the moment of truth.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

I search to see if Sydero is anywhere, only seeing her for a quick minute before she disappears within the crowd. My eyes go from one Cimmerian to the next, finally pausing when I see a figure in a black hood. Despite those standing around them, they stand out perfectly, a lively flower amongst the dead.

Asher taps my side, and I see that he’s looking in the same direction, “that is she.” I nod my head in thanks, sending him to tell the guards to slow down or stop altogether. With him gone, I begin moving towards the figure, my eyes never drifting. I feel for the dagger that I had grabbed earlier that day, exquisitely made from what Asher said, and beautiful to the eye.

I pull my blade out slyly, still hiding it in the sleeve of the long shirt that I had on. I weave my way through the crowd until I get right behind the witch, deftly grabbing the hilt in my hand as I walk by her.

“Pardon me,” I say.

“No, it is my fault,” she says but immediately stops as I settle the blade up against her throat.

“You need to come with me,” I whisper, gazing around to see if any of the guards were watching, or if I could spot Sydero.

“Lord Doran’s request, I take it?” she asks me, visibly looking frightened. I remind myself that she again doesn’t know that it is me. She still believes that I was an Alyrian, preparing to face whatever kind of execution the Cimmerians have planned.

[[“My Lord wishes to question you further.”]]

I walk to her side, behaving as if I just needed a better position to see what was going on stage. She doesn’t turn and doesn’t regard me, probably believing me to be just another bystander, curious to see the execution take place.

I look around, hoping to spot Sydero or to at least see how Asher was faring. I see Sydero first, gazing around. When she spots me and our eyes connect, I nod to her beside me, making sure it was obvious what I was trying to say without words. I see Syd nod once and then she was on the move. I spot her randomly, blending in with the crowd one minute, and then the next, standing out. Each time I see her, she’s yards closer until she is right behind me. She passes behind me, and I spot the light reflecting off the blade in her hands.

Suddenly, a guttural howl emerges from the witch, and black smoke rushes out of her, clashing straight into Sydero and sending her flying through the crowd. The Cimmerians surrounding us scatter in fear and shock, all trying to get away from the witch. Seeing that I wasn’t running, the witch turns to me, her eyes slowly widening in horror and understanding.

“You,” she growls.

I let out an involuntary shriek as her pupils become two, and each one of them has murderous intent inside of them.

“You killed my family!” she shouts, rushing towards me. Everyone in her way, moving as the crowd hustles to get out of the way. The black mist coming from her body knocks body after body out of her way, any guard that dares get to close. One of the tendrils wraps around my neck, cutting off any kind of air supply. I claw at it, but my fingers go straight through, doing nothing.

“$name,” I hear the Entity speak, his voice on the edge of my consciousness, sounding uncharacteristically calm, “she has the power to kill you. Let me help.”

The tendril holds me in place as she glares at me in the face, “you will pay.” The tendril squeezes. Though it is merely a tendril, I can feel it prickling my skin.

“$name!” the Entity shouts, “just let me take control. Don’t let your pride kill you.” I’m slipping, I can feel that much, and staring into her eyes, I know that no sympathy rests within them.

“Then why the blade?” she growls, spitting. The spit that flies from her mouth barely misses the Cimmerian in front of her.

“He spoke that you may be ... unwilling and that such force may be required.” She seems to believe me, and I tug her, but she refuses to move.

“Can I see the executions first?”

“Doran sits to the left of the platform; your view will be much better there.” She falls for my lie and allows me to guide her away from the crowd, and to the outskirts. As we walk, I see Sydero separate herself from the crowd, walking towards us, though her attention is solely on the stage. She walks closer to us and right before she passes, I see the light reflect off of a blade.

Before I can even think up a suitable answer, my body is launched by some unseen force. Cimmerians shout and dart out of the way as I land, pain shooting up my back upon impact.

“What do you want?” the woman questions. He is unable to even answer when a guttural howl sounds and suddenly, a dark mist shoots out of the woman and hits me square in the chest. It knocks me off my feet and I’m sent flying a few feet away. I groan at the pain that radiates through my back, attempting to refocus.

“You!” the witch growls, stalking towards me, her attention off of Asher and now completely on us.

“You killed my family,” she says sadly, pinning me down to the ground. I look to Sydero for help but find her occupied with a clone of the witch, she in the exact same position as I.

“Your family was killing innocent people,” I growl, trying to grab her neck, anything that would relinquish her hold on my neck. I look her in the eyes and my own widen, she had two pupils in each eye.

“What are you?” I question, barely getting the question out as the last of my air abandons me.

“I am your end,” she says, her voice now much more profound.

“I got you,” Asher shouts, but I see him nowhere. Then the woman over me begins to tremble uncontrollably. Blood begins to spill from her nose and the sockets of her eyes. She coughs up blood, choking on it as the blood escapes its flesh prison. I quickly move out from under her, right as her body explodes. My heart thumps wildly at the sight, nothing but organs, blood, and other gushy parts resting about. Sydero stays where she is, her gaze on the sky now that the woman’s clone was gone.

A shadow manifests, Asher sheepishly looking from the mess to me.

“I apologize, I hate to use that ability, but I saw no other choice.”

I open my mouth to respond when the voice from earlier is heard saying, “neither do I.” Asher turns in shock, only to be hit by a stream of jet-black mist, shooting him yards away from us.

“Asher!” I shout and attempt to run towards him but fail miserably. Something is dragging me down, refusing to relinquish its hold.

“Syd!” I shout but see that she’s nowhere in sight. I glance back to see a dark whirlwind of sand dragging me into its depths.

“Seems like you’re in such a tough situation,” I hear someone chuckle, on the edge of my mind do I see their ghostly figure. “Do you need help?”

“Never!” My leg goes through the whirlwind, feeling as if a million tiny insects were chomping down on it all at once. I scream out in pain, my voice distant and unclear, as if from another.

“I can get you out of this,” he sings, “or you can continue to be stubborn.” His voice seems right there on my ear, tickling the nerves with his breath, “I can give you so much power.”

I clench my eyes closed as the pain intensifies, traveling farther up my leg.

“How you figure that?” Sydero asks, leaning forward and looking at the shelter.

“There’s a good chance she’s seen Asher’s face when she was there. If he can persuade her that Doran seeks her audience, maybe we could jump her as soon as she comes out.” Sydero pokes out her bottom lip and nods impressively, agreeing with the plan in that action. Asher seems less reluctant but, in the end, agrees as well.

We stay back, allowing Asher to approach her tent. He doesn’t necessarily go in. Instead, he calls for her from the back of his lizard. A few seconds later and she comes out, her attention entirely on Asher.

“Let’s go,” Sydero whispers and the two of us dismount, creeping closer. We’re so close to sneaking up on her when a guttural howl sounds and suddenly, a dark mist shoots out of the woman and into the two of us. It knocks us off our feet and sends us flying a few feet away. I groan at the pain that radiates through my back, attempting to refocus.

“You!” the witch growls, stalking towards us, her attention off of Asher and now wholly on us.

“You killed my family,” she says sadly, pinning me down to the ground. I look to Sydero for help but find her occupied with a clone of the witch, she is in the exact same position as I.

&lt;&lt;if $entitytakeover&gt;&gt;\
	I dart upwards, my eyes wide as I attempt to take in the world around me. I can make out the motel room, the tattered and ugly wallpaper, the minifridge and small television sitting on top of it. The second bed that rests beside the bed that I’m on.

	&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
		Chris is sleeping on the same bed as me, and Sydero on the other. Both look like they’re sleeping, but I knew better than to believe that.
	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
		Sydero rests on that bed, appearing as if she’s peacefully sleeping, but I knew better than to believe that.
	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

	I’m aware that I don’t have control of my body, the places that my eyes dart, isn’t under my influence. The feeling is otherworldly, knowing that you’re in your body and being able to concentrate on things without fully concentrating on them. For example, my own heartbeat. The way it beats creates an echoing feeling that can be felt throughout my entire body. This must be what it feels like to be hyper-sensitive.

	I hear a mumbling to my left and both the Entity, and I look over there, though he’s the one that narrows my eyes as he stares at the figure there. A woman in all black has Bradley, a sharp blade resting against his throat.

	“Get away from the boy,” I hear myself say in an animalistic tone. I raise a brow though at the feelings that travel through me, suddenly feeling over-protective. Was this the Entity? Did they truly feel so strongly about Bradley?

	“What are you?” the witch barks, her voice deeper and almost matching mine that the Entity controls.

	“Are you deaf?” the Entity questions as we stand, “release him, demon.” My eyes widen as I look at the woman, nothing about her giving me any clue that she was what the Entity had just claimed.

	“I think not,” the woman replies but she doesn’t sound so sure. I can practically smell the fear radiating off of her.

	“$name!” Bradley manages to squeak out, though his shout sounds more like a nervous question.

	“$name isn’t here right now,” the Entity answers and I can feel myself smirk wickedly. Their gaze goes from Bradley back to the woman, taking a step towards her. She takes a step back in fear, only to hit the wall that resides behind her.

	“Take another step, and I’ll cut the little boy’s throat,” she purrs, pressing the blade even closer, drawing a trace of blood. The movement sends a surge of anger that I know isn’t fueled solely by me. I feel a rush of power flow through me. The sensation takes over, putting me on a high that I’ve never felt before. The only thing I could compare it to was an individual who had downed countless energy drinks and caffeine. The feeling itself put me in an almost stupor state, perhaps because I was doing nothing but existing amongst the power.

	[[I craved this sensation, this power.-&gt;FC4]]
	[[This felt wrong.-&gt;FC4]]
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“Over my dead body,” I shout mentally. The Entity roars in displeasure, positively pissed off at my refusal to let them take over my body and do whatever they wish to do with it.

	The witch stands over me, she still has her hold over me, and my body is only growing weaker by the second. I needed to do something now.

	[[Head butt her with all my energy.]]
	[[Punch her off of me.]]

The plan was simple. Or at least that’s what Bradley kept trying to tell me. I was struggling to believe his words the longer I had to run. My footsteps echo off the damp gravel road as I sprint, struggling to find my way through the darkness. Numerous times I lose my footing due to a large puddle causing the path to become incredibly slick. The bag on my shoulder seems to increase in weight, reminding me of why I was being chased in the first place. I’d give anything to just check my phone to see how far I had left to go. Sydero had better gotten her hands on that bowl of hers.

I fly past another corner, my smile widening when I see the outline of a car idle in the distance, the only signs of someone being inside is the hardly visible outline of a figure inside. I dart to the familiar car, smiling hard as I’m almost there. Suddenly the door is thrown open, catching me right in the stomach. I hit the ground with mumbled groans, whimpering as I gather my wits about me again.

“You should watch where you’re going next time, Roe,” I hear a familiar voice say, the last voice I’ve ever wanted to hear. I groan though it comes out more like a whimper as I roll over just enough, staring into the golden eyes of Petri.

I inhale and then exhale the smoke, watching as it disperses and disappears in the night sky. I lean back, letting the feeling of the cold metal of my car spread across my body. The hot Carolina air to my front and the cold to my back. I raise my brow as the door of the bar opens and closes, Syd approaching with something in her hands. I toss the cigarette into the nearby cigarette receptacle and turn to her.

“Did you find it?” I ask, trying to get a peek at whatever she had in her hands. It wasn’t so much a large object, as it was a collection of papers.

“No, but I got a tip about where it might be. Hopefully, this will help,” she tells me, getting into the passenger’s seat. I back out of the parking spot and drive down the street, listening to Sydero as she mumbles about something under her voice.

	“The heck?” I mumble, cutting them off entirely and then cutting them back on.
	
	“$name!” I hear Sydero scream, my hands are shoved away as she jerks the wheel to the side. Suddenly my vision is back, and I see a car’s headlights drive by us, the driver mashing the horn as it safely drives past us and continues its journey down the road.
	
	“Hmm, so it does work,” I hear the Entity purr in my head, his chuckling slowly fading out as I’m once again aware of the world. Sydero guides the car to the side, and I slowly press on the breaks, feeling her glare from a mile away.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	The road ahead begins to grow dark and suddenly there is a horrible pain in my head. It felt as if someone was striking the side of my head, or as if a feral animal was trying to be free of a cage, which happened to be my head.
	
	“$name!” I hear Sydero scream, my hands are shoved away as she jerks the wheel to the side. Suddenly everything comes back to me, and I see a car’s headlights drive by us, the driver mashing the horn as it safely drives past us and continues its journey down the road.
	
	“I can do worse than that,” I hear the Entity hiss in my head, his chuckling slowly fading out as I’m once again aware of the world. Sydero guides the car to the side, and I slowly press on the breaks, feeling her glare from a mile away.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“Look I already hate your driving to begin with. Are you sleepy?”

“No,” I growl feeling the obnoxious headache that always comes on when the Entity’s presence is fading. I clutch my head, this being far worse than all the other times.

“Yea, no. Get out, I’m driving.” I don’t argue, clumsily getting out of the car and walking to the other side as Sydero passes me.

I collapse in my seat, clutching my head as it fades far too slowly for my tastes. The ride is peaceful enough though and if the headache wasn’t so horrible then I might’ve fallen asleep.

“No, and it’s not exactly an easy task. Sure, tracking it through online buyers is easy enough but I think it was sold offline. If so, it’s going to take a lot longer.” We all stare at him as he grows quiet. “But I’ll find it, no problem.”

I go straight to the bed after the conversation ends, feeling random pings of pain in different areas of my head. I zone in and out as they talk about this bowl that Sydero oh so badly needs. She had actually told me why she needed it, but I still didn’t understand. From what I can remember, the bowl was hers and was stolen from her some time ago. She seemed less upset about that part, probably because she deserved it.

In less than no time, I’m drifting off, my dreams nonexistent and my mind dark.

	“A local pawn shop posted an online ad about it. Not that far either, maybe two or three towns over.” Bradley types up something and brings up a map of where the pawn shop rests, my eyes immediately finding the distance and estimated time. It was only an hour away, not that bad. And if this bowl was as crucial as Sydero said it was, it would be worth it.

	“Ugh, there’s no need for a plan. I act on whims,” Sydero replies.
	
	“And how has that been working for you?”
	
	“Quite well, actually. Seeing that a whim is what kept you from dying that day, and we didn’t have a plan when we went after BB.”
	
	“A plan is safer.”
	
	“Says no one. What do we do when your plan fails? Huh?”

“How about a bet then?” Chris counters. His words gain Sydero’s ear, and before she gathers her pack, she stops to look at him. “I make a plan, if it works then we start making plans from now on. If you win, then we’ll continue your way.”

I roll my eyes while Chris nods in agreement, “fine, and if I win you have to say that Chris is a brilliant genius and I’m lucky to know him. And you also have to start calling me Chris the Fantastic.” I glance over at Sydero who has an inscrutable look on her face.

“I guess there’s something to say about humbleness, but I know I’m never calling you that because you won’t win, so deal.” They shake on it, finally allowing for us to leave and retrieve the bowl.

“Let’s see, take advice from the two people who always find themselves in danger? Or keep doing what I do best?” Sydero taps her chin in thought, “call me stubborn, but I think I’ll continue with not making plans.”

	On the way to the pawn shop, Chris goes over his plan that has Bradley and Sydero on search duty. While he and I will be talking to the pawn shop owner to not only see if we can learn where the bowl is but to also distract him in case the other two find it. No one was willing to buy the bowl, which involved hassling an otherwise outrageous price, and so stealing it was the only option. It was a simple plan, and from what I gathered, as long as we walked out with the bowl, Chris would win.
	
	“Everybody understands the plan and is ready?” Chris asks. The question is meant for all of us but the way he glares specifically at Sydero, I surmise that he’s only worried about what her comprehension of it is.
	
	“Your plan isn’t hard to grasp,” Syd snorts, getting out of the car and the rest of us follow.
	
	“Yea, just want to make sure you understand, or you’ll blame the plan failing because you don’t know how to follow one.” Syd doesn’t respond, instead choosing to enter the pawn shop. Bradley walks in next, five minutes later Chris and I enter. Unlike them, we make a beeline towards the worker at the register, getting his attention immediately.
	
	“We were wondering if you can help us with finding a specific bowl, we heard that it was sold here,” Chris begins.
	
	“You wanna be more specific about this specific bowl?” he questions, hardly paying us any mind as he continues to play on his phone. I bring up a picture and show the guy, watching as he straightens up.
	
	“I’ve got a lot of offers on it, why should I sell it to you? And what the hell is so interesting about this bowl?”
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	On the way to the pawn shop, we go over what we need. Seeing that Sydero and Bradley are the only ones who know what this bowl really looks like, we agree to have Bradley search for it. While he does that, Sydero and I will speak to the pawn shop owner to not only see if we can learn where the bowl is but to also distract him in case Bradley finds it. No one was willing to buy the bowl, which involved hassling an otherwise outrageous price, and so stealing it was the only option.
Bradley enters first, five minutes after Sydero and I walk inside the shop. Unlike him, we make a beeline towards the worker at the register, getting the worker’s attention immediately.

	I shrug and glance over at Chris, “I don’t know what the big deal is, I just like the designs and wanted it for myself.”

	“And what makes you think you can afford it?”

	“I don’t know, how about you tell me how much it is and then we’ll both figure that part out.” The man looks between Chris and me, trying to figure out if he wanted to sell the bowl to us or not.

	“You guys don’t look like you work for a museum.”

	Chris rolls his eyes and leans in so that they were eye to eye, “tell me, what do museum workers look like.”

	The man shrugs, “they wear suits?”

	“Are you asking or telling me. I don’t exactly see why we’re even having this conversation, does it matter who we are? All that matters is that we’re offering you a large sum of money for that bowl if you still have it. Are you interested or not?”

	“It’s an important artifact from India,” I begin, and the man gazes over at me, “the museum we work at believes it to be one of the only ones left.” That seems to get his suspicious gaze off of me. Instead, he inspects both Sydero and me.

	“You guys don’t look like you work for a museum.”

	Sydero rolls his eyes and leans in so that they were eye to eye, “and you don’t like you’re a dumbass but I’m not putting it past you.”
I quickly put an end to //that// conversation and give the man an apologetic look.

	“The creator of the bowl died a while back, that bowl is the last original piece that hasn’t been stolen for some museum,” I tell him.

	“Why sell it to you then when I can just give it to a museum for a much larger price?”

	Chris rolls his eyes and leans in so that they were eye to eye, “all you need to know is that we’re willing to pay a hefty sum for that bowl. A price that no one else can match. And, last time I checked, that’s what you were in the business of doing.” The man shrugs.

“You don’t even know how much the bowl costs,” he exclaims in shock.

“Neither do you. I can see it in your eyes, we’ve already topped the other buyer’s price by just saying five hundred.” The man continues to try and argue with me, and I continue to give him a hard time, slowly raising the price. This was mostly to keep his attention off of the other two, as well to make it seem like we knew what we were doing. I’ve been to a pawnshop only once before, and I know nothing happens without a bit of haggling.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	Out of the corner of my eye, I see Bradley holding the bowl, motioning for me to wrap this up and then meet them outside.
	
	“So, five hundred?” I question, “how about we let you think about it and then come back tomorrow for your answer?” I nudge Chris, and the two of us turn to leave, hearing the man laugh just as Bradley and Sydero get to the door.
	
	“So that’s it? You just walk into a man’s store, steal from him, and think that’s it?” Bradley is the first to make a move, sprinting out of the pawn shop before the man could do anything else. We’re about to follow when he laughs again, completely unable to stand because of how hard he’s laughing.
	
	“Oh, this has been an amazing experience. You know, I almost shit my pants when I saw you come in, Sydero.” She slowly turns to face him, as do Chris and I. “There was no way I thought I was going to make it out of this without you figuring out what was going on.” The bell rings, and I turn to see that Bradley had come back in, probably curious about why the rest of us didn’t book it out after him.
	
	“Here she was, the notorious Sydero, and she couldn’t even sense my own presence,” he leans forward with a devious glint in his eye, “you’re losing your touch.” I see her gulp, her entire body stiff as she probably reprimanded herself.

	“As for the rest of you.” He disappears for a moment, shuffling with something in his cabinets before reappearing. He’s holding an ancient bowl that looks like an exact duplicate to the one Bradley has. Sydero’s eyes widen, and she marches to Bradley, snatching the bowl from him. She runs her hands along the basin and eyes it carefully, throwing it to the side in anger. As soon as it hits the ground, it explodes into dust.

	“We knew you were coming. You’re not as sneaky as you like to think you are.” The man vanishes, and then reappears in front of Chris and I. He’s staring at the two of us, but his words sound like they’re meant specifically for Sydero. “The day of invocation is approaching, and you can’t stop it. Especially without this.” He stares at the bowl before waving goodbye, disappearing from the store.

	“Deal,” I remark, stretching my hand out for him to shake but Chris grabs my hand and lightly shoves me out of the way.

	“No, no deal,” he tells me, questioning my intentions with his eyes, he turns back to the man. He gives both Chris and I a suspicious look.

	“My friend doesn’t usually do negotiations. So, make it five hundred, and we’ll be in business.”

	“Five hundred? You don’t even know how much the bowl costs,” the man exclaims.

	“Bold of you to assume that I didn’t do my research on the bowl and its origins before coming here. The bowl is made out of teak wood from an old forest in India. Specially crafted for an individual, perhaps as a wedding gift or for something more specific. Regardless, it was sold to a collector in America under false pretenses and has been bouncing from one hand to another.” I fight to keep a serious face, not knowing if Chris seriously did his homework or if he was bullshitting to the highest degree. Either way, he has the man, and me, believing his words.

It was crafted by a religious shaman in the region with runes and markings that mean specific things, for a specific person. The bowl was lost and sold to America’s grabby little hands under false pretenses.” Sydero leans in, catching the man’s shirt in her grip as she yanks him closer, “the owner wants it back.” She lets go of him, shoving him backwards as she straightens herself up, waiting for what he was going to say next.

I’ve been staring at a dimmed computer screen, waiting for any new information to arise on the whereabouts of the bowl. Bradley bugged the pawn shop and hacked the cameras before we left, just in case the supernatural creature came back. Since then we’ve just been waiting for news.

“Admit it,” I hear Bradley say as the door to the motel opens. He and Sydero enter with bags of food, setting it down for consumption. I immediately begin searching for my order as they argue about whatever it was they found time to argue about.

“I’m not about to admit to something when I don’t know for sure,” she scolds, passing me a drink.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“What is this about?” Chris questions from beside me, feet propped up on the air conditioning unit as he starts on his burger.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	I accept it and look to Bradley, “exactly what is going on now?”
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“I have an idea on why Sydero couldn’t sense the man,” Bradley begins, turning back towards an annoyed Sydero, “that whole book traveling business and the spell took too much out of you. The magic there and the magic here are two different things, not to mention that spell was something you’ve never done, and it was entirely by yourself.” Now that I heard the words aloud, I found myself agreeing with them. Sydero was looking more tired with each passing day. She still had energy, but whenever she tried to do a spell or use any of her abilities, she was unable to.

“How about we do less worrying about me and my personal issues and pay attention to the location of that bowl. Anything yet, Roe?” Sydero questions.

“No. I’ve been watching the cameras and listening in. I think it would’ve been easier putting a tracking signal on the bowl itself.”

“How would I have done that? Huh, $name?” Bradley asks, and I shrug. I was just saying stuff now, not being serious about any of it.

We finish eating and take a break from watching the monitors, especially since we’d hear an alert if something significant happened.

I throw my stuff away and put on my shoes, taking a look at Bradley who sits bored at his laptop, books open in front of him.

	“Can I help you?” one of the watcher’s question and I tell him that we’re there to see Sydero, though I again must call her monster to sell the ruse. He points us down the walkway, instructing us to go all the way to find her cell. As we go, we pass by mostly men who were stripped down to just their underwear. They sleep on hard mats, and their cells are covered in their own excrements.

	“I think I’m going to be sick,” Chris mumbles as we go. I nod and tell myself to keep looking forward, to ignore the smell and the lack of utter hope residing in the prisoner’s eyes.

	When we get to Sydero’s cell, I notice all too quickly that it’s right across from a room that looks like it was for torture. I’m only able to see some things from the other side of the slightly ajar door, but what I can see makes my skin crawl.

	“Syd?” Chris questions and we both look to see Sydero with her back to a wall. Her cell was the cleanest by far but was also empty, she was the only thing inside. “I just have to ask, what do you do with your … bodily waste?”

	Sydero snorts, sending us a wide smirk, “this wouldn’t be my first time having to hold everything in, probably won’t be the last.” She stretches out, looking oddly at home in the small cell. I see welts and bruises scattered across her body, dried blood caking most of her person. And that was just what I could see.

	“What the hell are they doing to you?”

	“Torture, if you want to call it that,” she sits up and leans forward, “here I am, thinking that medieval people would know a thing or two about torture. I mean, have you seen the torture devices? But boy, was I disappointed.”

	Chris taps my side, “is it just me, or does she still seem like her usual self?” I nod, placing my eyes back on Sydero.

	“So, any news about how we get out of here?” she asks, and we both shake our heads.

	“We’re still trying to figure that part out. The only thing we can think of is to ask Esther, our servant helper, to point us to someone mystical.”

	“But, that’s pretty hard to do,” Chris adds, “from what we know, humans here aren’t really magical.”

	Sydero taps her chin in thought, “$name? Anything that might help from what you read? Religious figures, maybe?”

	My eyes widen at her words and the idea that I begin to formulate, “the gods here, I think they’re active in some way. Maybe they have a shrine or a temple that we can go to. I can ask Esther if there are priests or any kind of ceremony that we can do.” The two nod and before anyone could say anything more, Chris turns on his heel and leaves.

	“What the hell is his problem?”

	[[“No idea.”]]

Things of beauty. But boy, was I disappointed.” She gets to her feet and leans against the wall closer to the cell’s bars.

	“So, any news about how we get out of here?”

	“I’m still trying to figure that part out. The only thing I can think of is to ask Esther, my servant helper, to point us to someone mystical. But, as far as I know, humans don’t have any magical abilities here.”

	Sydero taps her chin in thought, “well, is there anything else that might help from what you read? Religious figures, maybe?”

	My eyes widen at her words and the idea that I begin to formulate, “the gods here, I think they’re active in some way. Maybe they have a shrine or a temple that we can go to. I can ask Esther if there are priests or any kind of ceremony that we can do.” Before leaving I tell her that I’ll be back with anything new, hopefully tomorrow would be another milestone.

	“No idea,” I tell her, sighing deeply, another pit opening in my stomach.

	“Aw, and that’s killing you inside, isn’t it?” Sydero asks with a shit-eating grin.

	“I just would like to know what his issue is.”

	“Well, I know what one of his issues is,” Sydero tells me, shrugging nonchalantly, “you.”

	“Me?”
	
	“It’s not rocket science. The two of you have enough pent up energy to fuel a nuclear reactor. I think both of you just need a good humping,” she snorts. Also, ending the conversation there. I flick her off before telling her that I’ll visit again later, to update her.

	“No idea,” I tell her, shrugging my shoulders. If Chris wanted to have some mysterious attitude, then he could have it.

    The next day, I search for Esther in hopes that she can lead me to the temple she told me about the other day, as well as to tell me exactly what I need for the offerings. The book didn’t have much on it or at least the part that I could recall reading. I remember something about the moon, and darkness, I believe. Other than that, I can’t think of anything else. Maybe those were the only gods, though I suppose it would only make sense for the sun to be one as well.

		The next day, I get up early and search for Esther. She wasn’t in town or in the castle, and the more I look for her, the more lost I become. It would’ve been wise to at least invite Chris to come, but then, I didn’t want to hear his voice or experience that record winning attitude of his. Chris was a laidback kind of guy, attitudes were rare for him, which only meant that whatever was bothering him was big. But I couldn’t do anything about him not wanting to tell me.

	I put my mind back on the temple and if I would need an offering or not. The book didn’t have much on the deities or at least the part that I could recall reading. I remember something about the moon, and darkness, I believe. Other than that, I can’t think of anything else. Maybe those were the only gods, though I suppose it would only make sense for the sun to be one as well.

	As I walk through the town in search of Esther, I freeze, my eyes landing on a large piece of parchment that was nailed to a sturdy wooden board. The largest words are those that say ‘Execution’. Underneath that, the paper details the execution, when, where, and who. Of course, it was Sydero’s execution and it was to take place tomorrow, giving us almost no time. It was bad enough that we were still at square one with figuring out how to get out of here, but now, there was this.

	In anger, I tear the paper down and ball it up, throwing it to the side as I walk further into the town.

“Wanna dance?” I ask with a smirk and though he rolls his eyes, he accepts. He leads me back out to the main part of the floor and takes lead.

“So, while you were over there, did you get any more information on what we need to do?”

I roll my eyes but indulge him, “exactly what did you want me to ask her that we already didn’t?”

“How about how we get out of here. They don’t have witches but there has to be some wise figure that might be able to help us.”

“Asking her that means we have to tell her the truth.”

“Then tell her, whatever gets us out of here, right?”

Her eyes dart from one noble person to the next, and she shakes her head so fast that her hair slaps her across the face.

“I cannot,” she begins to tell me, but I wave that excuse away.
“Because you’re a servant? If someone says something, then I’ll just put the blame on my ignorance and my lack of decorum.”

“But this will tarnish your reputation,” she continues.

“I’d care if I had one,” I smirk and nudge her gently, extending my hand towards her. “Think of it this way, if I’m your better, then you can say that you were too afraid to tell me no.”

She takes one last look around before putting her hand in mine. I lead her to the dance floor, and though the steps to the dance elude me, I fake it till I make it.

I’m more than aware of the eyes that land on us, of the whispering and even some of the pointing that the braver nobles partake in. But I don’t care, and after a few minutes, it would seem that Esther doesn’t either. Perhaps she was stiff, to begin with since she feared someone would approach us. But after no one does, her posture relaxes immediately, and she even sends me a thankful smile.

I blush as the words come out of my mouth, though the blush only lightly paints my cheeks, the other half of me was still annoyed with Chris.

“We have work to do,” he tells me, “we don’t have time for pointless dancing.”

“Of course we don’t,” I say sarcastically, “we also don’t have time for this attitude of yours. Which, I should mention, you still haven’t told me the origins of. What? Are you still mad about me not helping you earlier?”

“Let it go, $name. I don’t care about that anymore.” That’s all he says as we continue to dance, an action that not two full minutes ago, I was excited about doing. Now, it seemed as empty and pointless as this feast. I pull away before the song finishes, causing Chris to look at me in shock, as well as me impeding upon a nearby duo. With my head low, I mutter an apology and retreat back to my seat from earlier. I was ready for this day to come to an end.

As I take her through the steps, I begin to question her, innocent questions that wouldn’t spur suspicion at first. After getting to know her a bit better, I finally ask the question that I wanted to ask in the beginning.

“So, this place doesn’t have any witches?” I ask, and she sends me a questioning look.

“No, only humans live here. Why?”

“I need … guidance,” I try out, “and my previous town had a few mystical beings that could provide assistance?”

“The Kre, then?” I nod my head as if knowing what that word meant. She becomes silent, spinning around before an idea lights up on her face.

“Would the temple be helpful? If you believe in the gods, then you can make an offering to them, and if they find you worthy, they might help you.” I nod. I remember reading about the gods here, far more active in this world than the religious figures in mine. It might even be interesting to see what will happen.

I slowly pull her closer to me, tightening my grip around her waist as we sway. She blushes softly, beginning to hide her face before realizing that the only way to do that, would mean resting her head on my chest.

“I think I can get used to you smiling, it’s beautiful,” I tell her, copying the moves of someone close by and taking a step back, twirling her, and then resuming our previous stance.

“You are far too kind,” she murmurs.

“Tell me, Esther. Do you have someone special here?” Her eyes bulge at my words, and she chuckles softly while shaking her head.

“No, I never thought to start looking.”

“Hmm,” I murmur. Though, I don’t know how fair this would be since I wouldn’t be here forever. As we head back to our seats, I think about it deeper. I was attracted to Esther, no doubt, but it would be foolish to get attached.

I notice that there are other servants with her, all looking at other produce.

“Esther,” I say, sliding up to her.

“Oh, $name, can I help you with something?”

“I need your help with finding the temple.” She frowns, looking at her near-empty basket and then the other servants.

“I will be able to help you later today, but I have work to do right now.”

“This is urgent.”

“The gods are not low on patience,” she jokes, continuing her inspection. I understood why she didn’t want to help me. This was her job and stopping could probably land her in more trouble than I’m worth. But I needed her help.

There, you could see the power that most churches held, their money giving them better homes and facilities than many others. The temple here looked shabby at best, as if someone knew the importance of having one but other than that, cared little.

“Is this what they all look like?” I ask, running my hand along a grimy stone.

&lt;&lt;if $truth&gt;&gt;\
	“No, the one near my home was beautiful and well-kept, dozens of people flocked there every day. Pryce cares little for the gods, only seeking them out when they need something, or to be forgiven.”

	“No, the one near my home was beautiful and well-kept, dozens of people flock there every day. Pryce cares little for the gods, only seeking them out when they need something, or to be forgiven.” She gives me a sidelong look, and I ignore it. If anything, that just meant I would fit in here if I weren’t able to reverse this.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

We enter, and I see the truth in her words even more. Not only is the inside barely decorated, but the only light comes from the many windows located along the walls. I also notice that we haven’t seen one priest, and there’s no one else in here. I see little reason to even have this place if it is barely visited. Esther stays by my side as I venture around, noting the many cobwebs on both the statues, dying plants, and the ceiling. Besides the sparse decoration, three statues rest on each wall. One shows a hooded figure with one arm hidden and his other hand extended, palm up. Another is of a woman in a flowing dress, both her hands extended. The last is of a strong man with his chest puffed out, his left hand is open but barely.

&lt;&lt;if $truth&gt;&gt;\
	“Darkness, Moon, and Sun,” Esther tells me, pointing each one out, starting with the first one that I had seen.
	
	“Does this really work?” She shrugs, taking a seat on one of the dusty chairs.

	“I’ve never tried. I never thought I needed to be in the God’s favors, I have only ever prayed to Moon. Unless you ask if they truly hear you, if so, I think it all depends on your intentions and how honest you are.”

	“Does it matter who I ask for guidance?”

	“Hmm, yes. Each god has their own behavior. You have Darkness who favors chaos and emotions, Sun favors those of strength and power, and Moon craves for those who are sensitive and wise.”

	“So, I just go to the one I think can best help me?”

	“Yes, go to the one you feel most connected too.” I nod and look at the three statues, biting the inside of my cheek.

	“I will be over here,” Esther told me, taking a seat off to the side. I look from the statues to her in a panic, not knowing what to do next.

	“Um, what do I do?”

	“You mean you do not know? Of course,” she murmurs and points to the first statue I saw, the hooded one. “That is Darkness, that is Moon, and that is Sun. You need to pray.” I nod and look at the three statues, biting the inside of my cheek.

“Alright,” I begin, dragging her away from the others, “here’s the truth. I’m not from here.” I start, and she nods in understanding, but I stop her. “No, I don’t mean Pryce. I mean I’m not from here, this world. I live on a planet called Earth, this world, this is just a book in mine. You’re a character that I read about while I was lounging on my bed.”

“This all sounds strange,” she says, fear dotting her eyes as she moves away from me.

“Please, Esther. I need your help, and I can’t get back without your help. A powerful witch brought my friends and me here, and unless we figure out how, we can’t return. Even more so, that creature, that’s one of my friends, she’s going to die unjustly if I don’t hurry up and figure everything out, now.”

“Do you hear yourself?” she scolds in a low voice.

“Yes, trust me. This past month, I’ve learned to never say anything is impossible. Please, help me.”

“Do you have proof of this?”

I didn’t have time to stand here and tell her the truth, it would take too long, and she wouldn’t believe me either way. It would be similar to when I told Chris about the supernatural, only this was far more farfetched.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“The truth is, my partner and I have done a few things we’re not too proud of. And a seer told us that unless we repent immediately, we will be cursed for the rest of our lives. My partner doesn’t believe it, but I do, and I’m terrified.”

	“What kind of things?” she asks in fear.

	I wanted to say, ‘nothing too bad,’ but that would downplay the importance. Yet, the look in her eyes scared me, made me seem like I was some sort of monster.

	“We are notorious hunters for a reason, there’s been a few toes we stepped on and a few lives that we took to get our mark. Innocent people sometimes get in the way.” The fear stays in her eyes, and I wonder if she thinks that her life could be in danger if she doesn’t help me. She gulps and turns to another servant, whispering to them before handing over her basket.

When she returns to my side, I notice that she keeps ample space between us, but she nods.

“I will show you to the temples immediately, come.”

“Yes, which oddly, is not the weirdest thing to leap off your tongue.”

I ignore that, “well, I can tell you things you haven’t told me that I know. You’re a servant here, but you’re actually from Nidinia. Your father died when you were young, and your mother came here because she had connections, connections that could help you out. You became a lady in waiting after that for a Lady, but she did something, I don’t remember, and you ended up being moved to a servant for the castle. You actually knew Terryn, not much, but you did know them.”

The look that comes across Esther’s face tells me that I was spot on, the pure shock and fear in her eyes, causing me to even become uncomfortable. The basket falls off her arm as she stares into the distance. I drop down to pick it up, along with the fruit that rolls away.

“My entire world … is merely a book?”

“Well, I don’t know. Just in my world. From what I see, this place is real. Maybe a different dimension or space or something like that, I didn’t take science that seriously back home.”

“And … this Earth, that is where you’re from?”

“Yea. See, we don’t have elves and Cimmerians where I’m from. We have werewolves and vampires and shapeshifters.”

“Vampires?”

“They’re undead people who look really attractive, their skin is glittery, and they drink everyone’s blood.” I’m pretty sure if Sydero was here to hear me say that, she would slap me.

“That sounds so strange.” I give her a minute to think about everything I said and to have it sink in. If she were anything like me, then she would probably need a week. I didn’t just tell her that a bunch of creatures weren’t fictional, I told her that there’s a whole other world and that I was from it.

But that was the thing, wasn’t it? We didn’t have a week. We had a day.

Thankfully, I did. Of course, there are no bars, but that’s not what was important. I call Esther to my side and show her all the things I can on the phone, bringing up my messages and games as well.

It takes about ten whole minutes just for Esther to tear her attention away from the phone, but she seems more than convinced that I’m not from here. Her amazement is replaced by a stricken look.

“So, will you help me?” I finally ask her after a long moment of silence. Esther looks around, her gaze going to the castle that stands in the distance.

“Yes. I will. Come, we must be quick if your words hold true.” I smile, and she gives her basket to one of the other servants, talking to them in a low voice. I’m unsure what she tells her, but the servant seems to nod and accept whatever Esther tells her, allowing Esther to lead me away from the town.

I take a deep breath in and go before Moon’s shrine. I sit down in front of her shrine and close my eyes. How does one even pray to the Moon? I think about the moon itself, the glowing orb that lights the sky up at night. I think about the symbolism that I know of, and then about what she probably represents. Words begin to formulate, and I continue on, hoping that this was working.

As I pray, a light mist appears. I know my eyes are still closed, this almost feels like the world I go into when the Entity is speaking to me and playing tricks. I see a twinkle, and then another, and then hundreds more join it.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	A soft caress of a whisper tickles my ear and someone whispers, “answer me this.” Three familiar faces appear, each residing in their own star as scenes play out. “If you could only save one, who would it be?” My eyes move from Sydero, a rare smile decorating her features as she rolls her eyes playfully, yet the smile never leaves. Then I look at the star that holds Chris’s face, he’s dancing in what resembles a motel room, laughing at something. The last star holds Bradley’s face, he’s saying something, obviously getting excited the more he talks. Someone not in view says something, and he pouts, licking his tongue out at them.

I sit down in front of his shrine and close my eyes. How does one even pray to Darkness? I think about darkness itself, all the fear that encapsulated it, and yet the mystery and beauty that it could also hold. I knew, better than anyone, how scary it could be. I hold onto that, even if it was unwise. Words begin to formulate, and I continue on, hoping that this was working.

My vision darkens, and I find myself in what I believe is a cave. Only coming to that conclusion due to the humid air, the aura that I feel, and the feeling of the walls against my hand. No lights within sight, and though I hear water nearby, I’m unable to tell which direction it resides. My view is cut off, unable to even make out figures.

“Rarely am I sought out by an Alyrian,” I hear a deep masculine voice exclaim from somewhere, “but you’re not truly Alyrian, are you?”

“No, but you knew that,” I speak, wishing I could see anything, even the tiniest sliver. My hopes are answered by a golden orb, it approaches me, and I realize that the spheres belong to the figure speaking to me, they were his eyes. I can’t make out the rest of his towering figure, but I do notice a hood.

“Darkness?”

“Indeed. What brings you to pray to me?”

“I … I wanted to ask you something,” I manage to say, and he nods his head. He turns his back to me, cutting off my only light source.

“I know, I have been watching you in interest since you appeared in this strange world of ours. We have never had a visitor from another world.”
“Then you know I seek to get home, can you help me?”

“I can. But I sense there is something else amiss within you.”

I clear my throat, the thought had been forming ever since I walked into the temple, “I have … this voice, within my head. I have so many questions about them, but I need to know the truth. Can you help me with that as well?” I watch as those golden eyes of his focus on me. They stare at me, breaking past all my defenses, tearing down everything within their path, nothing would be left. Every part of my soul felt like it was nude and on display, stripped of everything that made it unique.

And then it stops.

“You have a malicious spirit within you. One whose soul matches the same tainted spirit as my own children,” he tells me.

“So there is something there …”

“Because you are not of this world, there is only so much I can see and understand. What I do know is what I have just told you and that it is still trying to learn you.”

“Learn me? They know me, trust me. They’ve been with me since I was a child.”

His eyes narrow, “this is not possible. I was able to read this spirit easily, and it is still new.”

“Is it possible that it just seems fresh because it happened a while ago? Even though I know them?”

“No. What I feel is not that. This spirit is not the same.” I take a deep breath in and out, for the first time ever, I wish for the Entity to speak. But of course, the one time I need it, they don’t. The Entity … wasn’t the Entity?

“As for your other problem,” he continues, “there is a spell that I can gift you, but only someone with a firm grip on magic can use it.”

I think about the sun itself, or at least what it symbolizes back on Earth. I think about its pride and power, how it fuels life and brightens the day. Words begin to formulate, and I continue on, hoping that this was working.

As I pray, a bright mist appears. I know my eyes are still closed, this almost feels like the world I go into when the Entity is speaking to me and playing tricks. I see a blinding light that refuses to retreat.

An authoritative voice whispers, “answer the question. Do you wish you were a supernatural being?”

	I feel something nudging me forward, towards a massive glowing star, and then everything becomes bright. A few minutes later am I able to see and I find myself before a beautiful oasis. The water is a cerulean blue, which is paired beautifully with the pink petals falling off of nearby cherry blossoms. In the distance, the water continues, until the horizon cuts it off. The sky is a shade darker than the water, with a million stars glimmering. I search for a moon, believing it would be in the sky since that was who I prayed to, but see no one.

	“How can I help you, foreigner?” I turn on my heel, and my eyes widen at the beautiful woman there. Her skin is a deep rich brown, pairing wonderfully with the bold white dress that draped across her figure. This was Moon, this was the goddess, it had to be. Her beauty was ethereal, just staring at her made me feel at peace, and even in this foreign land, I felt like I belonged.

	“I … I wanted to ask you something,” I manage to say, and she nods her head. She moves her flowing white hair out of the way, and her silver eyes land on me.

	“I know, I have been watching you in interest since you appeared in this strange world of ours. We have never had a visitor from another world.”

	“And yet, you don’t seem surprised.”

	“We have had other strange occurrences, and the magic here never ceases to amaze me. You wonder how to get back home?”

	“I do, can you help me?”

	She nods but gives me a pointed look, “tell me what else ails you as well.”

	I clear my throat, the thought had been forming ever since I walked into the temple, “I have … this voice, within my head. I have so many questions about them, but I need to know the truth. Can you help me with that as well?” I watch as she calls down a star, the sizeable burning mass growing larger until it suddenly shrinks to fit into her hand. She kisses it gingerly and then blows on it, the star traveling my way. I don’t know what to do if I should catch it or just let it do whatever it wants. And so, I stand stiffly, watching as it floats to my forehead. As soon as it touches, my world again goes bright, and when it dies down, I’m back in the goddess’s peaceful sanctum.

	“Well, the good news is that you are not crazy,” she tells me, attempting to smile, but it only comes off as saddened.

	“But?”
	
	“Because you are not of this world, there is only so much I can see and understand. What I do know is that a malicious spirit lives within you, one that is still trying to learn you.”

	“Learn me? They know me, trust me. They’ve been with me since I was a child.”

	Her face wrinkles up in confusion, “this is not possible. The energy I received is still fresh, only recently has this spirit ever been attached to you.”

	“Is it possible that it just seems fresh because it happened a while ago? Even though I know them?”

	She shakes her head, “no. What I feel is not that. This spirit is not the same.” I take a deep breath in and out, for the first time ever, I wish for the Entity to speak. But of course, the one time I need it, they don’t. The Entity … wasn’t the Entity?

After the star gives me the memory, I suddenly feel myself zapped forward, and yet again I sit in front of the goddess’s shrine. 

Esther wishes to hear nothing but what the deities were like, how they looked and spoke. If they were as kind as she might’ve believed, or as ruthless as others said. Despite actually talking to them, I can’t recall much, only crucial elements. I now know a spell that was useless to me, but helpful to give to Sydero to get us back home. But even more than that, the Entity wasn’t who I thought they were, who they said they were. They were another being entirely. And more than anything, I wished to get answers regarding this. But they remained quiet as if never existing. Which we both knew was a lie.

When it finally dims, I find myself in a desert landscape, though it mirrors that of a healthy oasis. The sky is a faded yellow with splashes of blue, clouds dancing around as if playing tag with their neighbors. Though the land is harsh, cactuses with lush fruit and bright flowers are everywhere. A small lake resides nearby, brimming with life.

“You came to sightsee?” I hear the same voice from earlier ask, though it’s much more authoritative and it belongs to a figure that looks like he could snap me in two with a blink of his eye. The man is barely dressed, wearing nothing but a chest plate and a loincloth to cover what might be his extremities. He is muscular beyond belief, every muscle decorating his golden tinted sculpted body has been given particular detail. He indeed looked like he could’ve been created by the Greeks themselves. Hercules and Zeus would fawn over this man. His white hair was braided into a bun, though a few pieces had managed to escape. Beyond that, his silver eyes look upon me in boredom, though an ounce of curiosity seems to rest within them. 

“No, but you knew that,” I speak, hoping I sounded confident. He’s currently sitting on a sturdy rock, leaning forward as he eyes me, “Sun, I take it?”

“Indeed. What do you want mortal?”

“I … I wanted to ask you something,” I manage to say, and he rolls his eyes.

“Obviously, otherwise why did you pray,” he stands and goes to a nearby Phoenix, petting it lovingly, “well, spit it out. I really do not have time for this.” I suppose there was something to say for his manners.
“You see, I’m not from –”

“Yes, yes, I know. I have been watching you since you appeared in this world. Wondering what the hell you wanted, because, you see, we have never had a visitor from another world.”

“Then you know I seek to get home, can you help me?” Faster we finished this conversation the better.

“Yea, sure. Is that it?”

I clear my throat, a thought had been forming ever since I walked into the temple, “I have … this voice, within my head. I have so many questions about them, but I need to know the truth. Can you help me with that as well?” He forms a cloud with his hands and pushes it my way.

“Grab it.” I do as he says, not knowing what to do after that, though. I just stare at it, until he tells me to send it back his way. He seems to study it as if there was something in the cloud that I hadn’t seen before.

“You have one mean spirit living inside of you. A filthy beast that needs to be exterminated,” he tells me. I wait to see if the Entity will speak up in their defense, but nothing.

“So there is something there …”

“Because you are not of this world, there is only so much I can see and understand. What I do know is that the thing is inside you, but it is still confused. Seems to be trying to learn you.”

“Learn me? They know me, trust me. They’ve been with me since I was a child.”

His eyebrow raises, “not possible. Granted, I hate these things as much as the next god, but I was able to read it easily, and it is still new.”

“Is it possible that it just seems fresh because it happened a while ago? Even though I know them?”

“Hey! The spirit is not the same, okay!” he barks in anger, causing me to shut up quickly. I take a deep breath in and out, for the first time ever, I wish for the Entity to speak. But of course, the one time I need it, they don’t. The Entity … wasn’t the Entity?

“As for your other problem,” he continues, “there is a spell that I can gift you, but only someone with a firm grip on magic can use it.”

	Almost a month, yet not quite. All of the things that have transpired in my life, all in less than a month. I suppose that’s how time really works. When the military dropped that atomic bomb, no one affected saw it coming until those fatal moments. Perhaps some of them thought about what they would eat for dinner, only to find themselves in the afterlife within the same hour.

	That was time. A good and bad thing. It teases us with the constant thought of, ‘I have more time’ or ‘I can deal with this tomorrow.’ When really, you never had the time you thought you had. Plans change, lives change, and everything folds.

	Morgan. Chris. My uncle. Just a few names that I thought of immediately, names of those who time strutted in and gave them a reality check. Then there were folks like Sydero, Bradley, and Faye. Those who already had their one on one with time and learned that it was never on their side. Learned that time played a game similar to survival, only time liked to manipulate and tease more.

I stand by Chris, handing him the tools he needs whenever he asks for them, but otherwise not doing much else. I don’t say much either, listening to him work on the car. But that simply brings a thought to my mind.

“Where did you learn car maintenance?” I ask, gazing over at him with curiosity in my eye.

“My father and grandfather taught me. At first, I didn’t really care much to learn since my father wanted to teach me. But my grandfather was excited to teach me some stuff, so I learned.”

“Just the basics or?”

“Basics and then some, intermediate I guess you would say. Enough to do stuff like this but not enough to open my own shop or anything.” I lean further on my car, humming in thought.

“Would you want to?”

“No, heck no. Always thought it was a nice skill to have, but never actually liked it enough to go any further into it. My dad even said that I should do engineering or something in college.”

“You know, I don’t think I ever learned what your major was.”

“That’s because I didn’t really have one until this semester, I kept going undeclared, told my folks that I was focusing on core before choosing. Went over well with mom, not so much dad. But … I was planning to go for Music Theory.”

“Really?” I ask in shock. I know Chris loved old and classic rock but anything other than that, no. He blushes, refusing to answer. He takes a step away from the car, bringing down the hood and then leaning his back onto it. I’m surprised to see him pull out an e-cigarette, going through the motions to get it filled up to smoke. As I watch, I suddenly find myself laughing, unable to stop.

“What the heck is so funny?” he finally asks once I have calmed down, partially.

“Man, I never thought I’d see you smoking one of those again,” I say, sighing happily.

&lt;&lt;if $cig&gt;&gt;\
	“Yea, never thought I’d get a chance. Saw a bunch of nice flavors and pens, so I thought, why not. Want a puff, I saw how mad you looked when you put your cigarette out.”

	I nod, pressing the button and then inhaling, enjoying the feeling that slowly overtakes me. I do it for a few more seconds before handing it back to Chris.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“Yea, never thought I’d get a chance. Saw a bunch of nice flavors and pens, so I thought, why not. The dumbest thing would be not to grab it and not have it around for the future.” I nod, happy that he at least had something to calm himself.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

&lt;&lt;if $jealouschris or $jealouschris2&gt;&gt;\
	The two of us sit quietly, one would think we were just enjoying one another’s company. But that would be untrue. Subtle awkwardness joins us as we both think about what has yet to be said. More from my end than his.

&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	I chuckle, quieter than last time but still loud, “how did we get here, Chris?” Before he can answer, I add, “I mean, I know how we got here. A lot of stupid decisions, some running was involved, a lot of cursing, and I think once or twice I might’ve stabbed something.” That gets both of us laughing, the sound was music to my ears as I just sit alongside my best friend from college.

	“But, the fact that we’re still alive and getting stronger. Seems crazy, right?”

	&lt;&lt;if $chris &gt;= 50&gt;&gt;\
		“Well, we do have an annoyingly good teacher and a kid that puts all of us to shame with how smart he is.” I nod at that.
	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
		“No idea how. Sydero’s a pain in the ass, and the kid doesn’t really help much either.” I don’t disagree or agree with him, especially since I knew he still wasn’t a fan of our traveling compatriots, Syd more than Bradley.
	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
	
	“Regardless, here we are. Remember sophomore year, when I told you that I’d take you on some wild stupid adventure?”

	Chris snorts at the reminder, “I sure hope you don’t mean this train wreck.”

	“Um, can I get a bit more gratitude?” I joke, finding my heart stutters as Chris stares over at me. I seem to forget what the conversation was even about as I shiver, despite it not being cold. Chris leans in just a bit, his eyes going down to the hood of my car.

	“$name, I need to tell you something,” he starts, but before he can say anything more, we hear Bradley scream from the room.

	“I found something.” I ignore him, he’d be okay for two more minutes, my eyes back on Chris.

	“What did you need to tell me?” Chris clears his throat, and just like that, the moment was gone, and everything was back to normal. He gives me a weak smile and nods towards the room.

	“We should see what he wants.” I’m about to disagree when I hear twigs snapping, Sydero appearing. She looks at the two of us as if sensing the previous air but says nothing. Quietly smirking as she leads the way into the motel room.

“She doesn’t want to be bothered,” he calls out, but I continue forward. She never wants to be bothered, this wasn’t much different than any other time I’ve just popped up on her.

I march in the same direction I saw Sydero disappear in, hoping she hadn’t gone too far when I finally find her. I stay back, silently watching as she tries to fling a rock. Sweat dribbles down her face, and even from my current distance, I can see her body trembling. The rock twitches and hovers in place for a few minutes before dropping back down. I jump in shock as Sydero lets out a loud shout, turning and planting her fist in a tree. Bark flies out in all directions, and leaves and pinecones fall to the ground. Sydero simply looks tired.

	I was slowly receiving the puzzle pieces that made up the jigsaw puzzle of my life. Only, there were a thousand pieces, and I’m pretty sure the wind had blown some of them across the yard. My luck in ever finding them dwindling significantly.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

Almost a month, yet not quite. All of the things that have transpired in my life, all in less than a month. I suppose that’s how time really works. When the military dropped that atomic bomb, no one affected saw it coming until those fatal moments. Perhaps some of them thought about what they would eat for dinner, only to find themselves in the afterlife within the same hour.

That was time. A good and bad thing. It teases us with the constant thought of, ‘I have more time’ or ‘I can deal with this tomorrow.’ When really, you never had the time you thought you had. Plans change, lives change, and everything folds.

Morgan. Chris. My uncle. Just a few names that I thought of immediately, names of those who time strutted in and gave them a reality check. Then there were folks like Sydero, Bradley, and Faye. Those who already had their one on one with time and learned that it was never on their side. Learned that time played a game similar to survival, only time liked to manipulate and tease more.

I swear, living on the road, doing the things we do, one would forget that they were traveling with a sixteen-year-old. Not to mention one who loved playing video games and probably heard the whole ‘revenge is not the answer’ storyline one too many times.

“And, you’re welcome,” Bradley says with a wide smile and a half bow. Sydero grabs him, bringing him to her and giving him a playful noogie. He escapes and though he sends her a glare, doesn’t seem displeased at her show of affection.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\

“Focus, both of you,” Sydero groans, motioning to the laptop and the unknown map, “where is it?” Bradley types something in, and an info panel pops up.
	
“The town’s museum, I guess they’re holding it there for the time being or something. Maybe even selling it to them. I just know that the museum momentarily put it into their database.”

“Does this mean we’re robbing a museum?” I question, sighing at the implications and the fact that I was still wanted. Anything that had to do with a crime was probably unwise for me to partake in.

“Seems so,” Sydero mumbles.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“Attempt number two,” Chris suddenly says, and though it takes me a while, I realize what he’s referring to.
	
	“No,” Syd says before any of us can, “your first plan was horrible.”
	
	“No, it was good, but we didn’t know that supernatural creatures were involved. Now that I do, we can plan around it.” No one disagrees, but that doesn’t mean we agree either. We silently wait as Chris thinks up a plan, much to Sydero’s dismay.
	
	“I got it. The museum will have minimum security at best, it’s a local museum after all. $name and I will go in and grab the security’s attention, run separate ways and draw them away from the area. All while Sydero sneaks in and grabs it. Bradley will wait in the car, ready to grab a fleeing $name, and then coming to the other side to pick me up.”
	
	“Let me get this straight,” I begin, clearing my throat, “you want the only person wanted by the law, to distract them?”
	
	“You can’t be the person to go grab the bowl because only Sydero will know if it’s fake or not. You can’t be the getaway driver because if Bradley’s grabbed, that’s a bigger problem than what any of us need.”
	
	“I hate the plan, but Chris has a point,” Sydero points out.
	
	[[“Bradley, you better be ready for me.”]]
	[[“Fine, whatever.”]]
	[[“New bet, one about how horrible this plan is going to end up.”]]
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“Should we make a plan?” Bradley asks, none of us immediately answering. None of us really was game for making a plan, but this was too important not too, too many things could go wrong.
	
	We each throw out random ideas, none of them sticking though.
	
	“I got it,” Bradley shouts, “$name will go in and grab the security’s attention, leading them away from the building. While $he does that, Sydero will sneak in and grab the bowl. I’ll be waiting in the car, down the road or something, so that’s where you run to. As soon as you’re in, we drive off and wait for Sydero.”
	
	“Let me get this straight,” I begin, clearing my throat, “you want the only person wanted by the law, to distract them?”
	
	“You can’t be the person to go grab the bowl because only Sydero will know if it’s fake or not. And I’m not athletically able, so I’ll probably get caught. And I just figured that me getting caught would bring up a lot more problems than you.”
	
	“I hate the plan, but Bradley has a point,” Sydero interrupts me, before I can question Bradley’s ideology, “if Bradley gets caught, then he’s in the system, and that’s two of you, not just one. Plus, he’s a minor, we have no idea what they’ll do with him. At least with you, we know where they’ll be taking you and how to get you.” I growl, pacing back and forth at the fact that I couldn’t disagree.

“And you’re just dying to know,” he questions, creating a smoke ring. I push the mild irritation away, attempting to stay calm.

“Yea, since it pissed you off quite a bit since you gave me the cold shoulder for almost a week after.”

“True, I was mad and irritated, but you make it seem like it just blew me. I already told you, I didn’t like that some stupid crush got you a better position. My own problem to deal with.

“What do you mean you don’t care?”

“Just that. You’re single, $name, you can do whatever you want. And so this apology means nothing, especially since you’re not apologizing for only one person, but two.”

“Look, it’s none of my business who you choose to have sex with, and frankly, I no longer want to even know. So, go fuck the entire world for all I care. I won’t look at you differently. But, stop bringing it to my attention.” The tone in which he said it made it clear what he meant by that, if I ever had a chance with him, my decisions have just ruined that. He walks past me and back into the motel room, right as Sydero appears. She looks at Chris’s retreating form and then back at me, not saying anything.

“I’m pretty sure it was here before you.”

“Well maybe in another life it’s punching the crap out of me,” she snorts and then sighs sadly.
&lt;&lt;if $Cimmerian&gt;&gt;\

	“Sydero, we really need to discuss you and Doran.”

	“And I really need for my BAC to be at .20% right now. Neither of us is getting what we want.” She attempts to move past me, and I stop her, glaring at her. She takes a deep breath before taking a step back. “What do you want me to say, Roe? I already answered your question.”

	“No. That’s the one thing you didn’t do. You gave me a damn look and then went on about your life.” She takes a step closer to me.
“Remind me, Roe. Are you single?” I open my mouth, stuttering for a moment since I already know where this is going. “Trick question, we both already know the answer. I’m pretty sure I’m single too.”

	“But you know –.”

	“I know that I’ve told you time and time again to leave it,” she weakly shoves past me, “you’ll only get yourself hurt.”

	“Don’t tell me what I will and won’t go through. I’m a big kid, in case you haven’t noticed.”

An awkward silence forcibly pushes its way into the small clearing, one that causes both of us to look anywhere but at each other. I feel myself thinking about the night at the bar, the feeling of Sydero’s lips against mine. The temptation and desire that I let seep into my skin at her closeness.

		“Why’d you stop?” I suddenly say aloud. I’m aware that I asked the question, but my mind is still off swimming in that pool of desire. The need to bring her closer to me and kiss her once again, to feel her body against mine.

“Like how Bradley said?”

“Probably. The fact that their magic is pure, it works differently than the magic here. There, I felt the magic in the air, it was like some invisible pressure that you wanted to breathe in constantly, but you had to learn how to breathe it first.

Sydero doesn’t move, her eyes slowly coming to rest on me once again. She stares at me, unspoken thoughts zooming around in that mind. I suddenly wish that thoughts could be projected, if only to see what she was thinking. She backs away slowly and then turns to walk off.

	We turn a corner, finding our first officer eating a candy bar. When he sees us, he doesn’t immediately take chase. Instead, he gives us a bewildered look, taking another bite of his candy bar.
	
	“Sorry, the museum’s closed. Come back tomorrow at nine o’clock.”
	
	“Or we can just do what we have planned right now,” I say, picking up one of the items on exhibit.
	
	“Um, you’re not supposed to touch that.” He tells me, but he still seems uneager to chase me.

So, who’s up for a new bet? This one is about how horrible this plan is going to end up,” I state and glare over towards Chris.

“Ooh, me. I’m totally up for betting on the failure of this plan,” Sydero grins, sending a wicked toothy grin Chris’s way. The playful banter dies down, as we all think about what we would be doing tomorrow night.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	The next day is filled with us talking through the plan more. Chris leading the discussion since it was his plan. Any questions and concerns are addressed, and two more back up plans are created in case something goes wrong. Surprisingly, I feel better about it all. Knowing that even if I somehow get caught, we had a backup plan for freeing me immediately.

One guard turns into two, and the two into five. I was more concerned about why a museum this size had five-night guards than actually getting away from them. Wherever Sydero was, I hope she was close to finding that bowl because it was time for me to go.

Numerous times I lose my footing due to a large puddle causing the road to become incredibly slick. The bag on my shoulder seems to increase in weight, reminding me of why I was being chased in the first place. I’d give anything to just check my phone to see how far I had left to go. Sydero had better gotten her hands on that bowl of hers.

I fly past another corner, my smile widening when I see the outline of a car idle in the distance, the only signs of someone being inside is the hardly visible outline of a figure inside. I dart to the familiar car, smiling hard as I’m almost there. Suddenly the door is thrown open, catching me right in the stomach. I hit the ground with mumbled groans, whimpering as I gather my wits about me again.

“You should watch where you’re going next time, Roe,” I hear a familiar voice say, the last voice I’ve ever wanted to hear. I groan, though it comes out more like a whimper as I roll over just enough, staring into the golden eyes of Petri.

I never thought I’d learn how hard a cell’s bed actually was. Getting comfortable was impossible and even worse, the smell made me want to throw up. Or perhaps that was because my cell was right across from a guy who had thrown up all over his. I approach the bars, immediately met by Langston and Petri. Both have satisfied smirks on their face, though Petri’s was more predatory than satisfied.

“I seriously feel like a bounty hunter right now,” Langston says, looking me up and down, “we finally caught you.”

“Congratulations, you caught an innocent person,” I reply.

“That’s not what this warrant for your arrest says,” Petri states next, waving a sheet of paper that looks as real as this cell, in front of my face.

“We both know I didn’t do anything,” I growl, hitting the bars and regretting it a minute later. The two of them laugh as they look like they get comfortable, both staring at the man, in the cell across from me, before their expressions change to one of disgust.

[[“When I get out of here, I’m whooping both of your asses.”]]

“When I get out of here,” I start, looking between both of them, “I’m whooping both of your asses.” This gets them laughing, Petri howling since I guess he wasn’t afraid to show me his real nature.

“I’m looking forward to seeing you free, Roe,” Petri tells me, “get used to a jail cell, Roe. With your crimes, you’re looking at life without parole.”

“You’re bold to assume that I’ll be in here for that long,” I remark with a smile. Yet the words that come out of Petri’s mouth next sends a shiver down my spine. Enough to cause me to doubt the confidence I had in others and my future.

He leans as close as the bars allow, baring those canines of his, “no one&#39;s coming to save you. Where do you think Raum is?” The question is left in the air as they both walk away, murmuring to one another. 

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	It didn’t matter what they said. I would get out of here, Sydero or Chris would come and save me. Maybe even Bradley. Regardless, someone would come. They wouldn’t just leave me here.

I head back to the bed, remembering them arguing with the sheriff about keeping me here until the transport truck arrived. It would be here in three days. My group had three days to figure out how to get me the hell out of here. I really did feel like a criminal, one who couldn’t step foot back into a state that once used to be their home. My entire world had changed, and I was about to pay the price for someone else’s deeds.

&lt;&lt;if $optimism &gt;50&gt;&gt;\
	No. I needed to stop thinking like this. I would be found. My group was some of the luckiest bastards I knew, uncannily lucky to add to that. One of them will find me, I had no doubt about that. I just needed to wait.

Chris unlocked the door, praying about what he’d find on the other side. He’d open it and find Bradley typing away on his keyboard, Sydero hovering close by and saying some rude remark. And then finally, he’ll see $name on the bed, wondering where Chris has been all this time. He’d probably say a few rude remarks about how they left him, but otherwise would claim that he won the bet. Yep, his plan was a success. They got the bowl … his plan was a success … Suddenly, the key in his grip felt a lot heavier.

//Let my plan be a success//, he whimpers.

And with a turn and a push, Chris’s hopes were dashed. Instead, he found a mostly empty motel room. A room that looked like it hadn’t been inhabited for a while. All of their stuff was gone, the beds were made, and that stale motel air freshener was in the air.

Chris backed out and tried his phone again, attempting to call Bradley but finding that his phone went straight to voicemail for the umpteenth time. He tries Sydero next, and then $name. Each one going straight to voicemail. This was a disaster. He collapsed on the front step of the room, rocking back and forth as he tried to think. He needed to figure out where everyone might be.

He and $name split up, Chris had two guards chasing him and then some cops once he was free. He was able to lose them after a while though and decided to wait out in an abandoned building until he thought it safe. But that was when demons appeared. Chris wasn’t equipped nor prepared for them, and so all he could do was flee. His blade helped some, but otherwise, his feet were to thank that night. He fled to a nearby church, taking refuge behind its doors and in the care of the preacher there.

His phone was dead, and his energy levels almost completely depleted. And so, as his phone charged, he slept. It was only when morning unveiled itself that the real mess revealed itself. No one was picking up their phones, and he had no idea where he was. It took three buses just to get back to the street of the motel, and he soon found that to be a wasted trip, no one was here.

Bradley’s eyes stayed closed despite the blaring horn coming from the car. It’s been going off for at least two minutes, all due to his forehead refusing to budge away from the button. The only reason he finally picked his head up was because the horn intensified the headache he was experiencing, making it unbearable.

“Shit! Shit! Shit!” Bradley repeatedly shouted, throwing a mini tantrum in the seat that he had been occupying for the entire night and morning. This wasn’t supposed to happen, not at all. And the worst part wasn’t even that it happened, it was that he didn’t know what to do. He’s tried everyone’s phone, and no one picked up. It went straight to voicemail on every single one of them.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“Breathe, buddy,” he tells himself, leaning his head back as he tried to think the night over again, trying to figure out where Chris and Sydero could possibly be. Bradley had waited all night when he finally heard that the police had captured a deadly fugitive. 
	
	Immediately, he knew that was $name. Bradley even tried to go after $him, driving past the police station when he spotted Petri and Langston hanging outside, on the phone with someone, he didn’t stay long enough to figure it out. He had then decided to go get Chris, to pick him up. But Chris wasn’t at the rendezvous point. He was nowhere to be seen and not answering his phone.
	
	The last person he tried was Sydero, and when she didn’t pick up his call after three rings, he began to panic. Everything had fallen apart in less than one night. Their plan was supposed to work.
	
	Chris’s plan wasn’t the best, but it was good enough to work, and that’s all that mattered. In their group, a group that never made plans, that was a decent plan. But perhaps, this was fate’s way of warning them against it in the future, if they had a future. The thought caused Bradley to stiffen even more.
	
	&lt;&lt;if $bradley &gt;= 50&gt;&gt;\
		There would be a future, even if he had to break every damn law. He was tired of seeing those he cared for taken away. Never again. He was going to figure out a way to get his family back. He put the car in drive, unsure of his destination. Well, his first destination would have to be the gas station, seeing that the car was near E, and he doubted $name would appreciate an almost dead vehicle.
	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
		What if this was it, the end of their road? He didn’t want to say it, but he could easily see Chris either taking off or getting his head chopped off. Inexperience wasn’t the best thing in this life, in fact, it could kill you faster than a defective weapon. $name would be sent to prison for crimes $he didn’t commit, and there was no way Bradley could get to $him there. And Sydero, well if Petri and Langston were close, then where was Raum? Sydero was at her weakest, not even able to pick up the presence of a demon right in front of her. That made his stomach worse than anything else. Was he truly all alone? 
		
		A small tear rolled down his cheek. Even when he was alone in his abandoned house, he knew he was never alone. He had Faye and Sydero. But now, now he felt the walls closing in, and there was no one left.
	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

//This was bad.//

//This was so very bad.//

Sydero’s only problem was figuring out which part of her entire situation was worse. Was it the &#39;being completely separated from her team aspect,&#39; the fact that she had no idea where she was, or the fact that if she could put numbers to her energy levels, then she would currently be at a twenty? Or maybe that was being too generous, because she honestly felt like she teetering on ten.

“Stop running and fight me!” she heard Raum scream. Oh, how could she have forgotten that she was practically being hunted? Even in her current state, she gave credit where credit was due. She knew the museum was going to be somewhat of a trap, in a way she believed they all knew that. No demon just grabbed and disappeared with the bowl they knew she needed, only to give it to a museum without any knowledgeable guards.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	She even thought Raum was behind it, somewhere. But the plan, after working it through her own mind, actually computed. While Chris and Roe captured most of everyone’s attention, with a clean getaway, she would go in and retrieve the bowl. The bowl was in the storage area, hidden among five hundred other pots that were probably all fake. But she had a somewhat bond with that bowl, there could be five hundred replicas of it, and she would know just by looking at it which was real. But that plan also included her and her abilities behaving normally.

&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

She grimaced at how long it took to find the correct bowl, having to channel her energy into the act. This was pathetic! And the longer she thought about it, the more it angered her.

“No,” she growled, fighting herself as she realized where that anger was leading. She felt ready to throw up, willing to just give up. Something was going to have to give soon. She still had another essence bottle at the motel, that would help, right? She wanted to laugh at that thought. Yea, because the other one she had gulped down had been tons of help. She was burning through them faster than usual.

“Sydero!” Raum screams from a farther distance than when she had last heard him. She shifted the bookbag straps, making sure it was tight. She then checked her phone, what she wouldn’t give to see Roe’s name light up on the screen right now. She knew where Roe was, Raum made sure he bragged about it when he first caught her. And almost got her a second time when she was a block away from the jail, ready to somehow break Roe out.

But now, now she was spent. She had no idea where she was. No idea how long her phone was going to stay lit up, and no idea if she was going to make it. And Raum knew all of this.

She just knew she had to run.

			Much to his dismay, he was starting to see the group as his family. Bradley, the annoying little brother, Sydero, the sister with an attitude, and $name, the friend that he was having a hard time forgiving, yet desperately wanted to. The friend that had slept with another, and yet, Chris was trying so hard to forget that little detail. No, that wasn’t a small detail, that was a significant detail that had hit him deeply. 
			
			As soon as he found out, realized what had happened, he told himself to stop looking at $name in such a way. Of course, $name was single, free to do as she chose. So why, no matter how many times he told himself that, it still hurt. The thought of another pleasuring her in ways that he couldn’t, mostly because he was too afraid.
			
			For a while, he wanted to sit $name down and speak to her, not necessarily about it, but his feelings. Maybe if he finally came clean about the crush that was going nowhere, then she’d stop. //Or she’ll laugh in his face and call him cute or something.// The feeling caused his stomach to turn upside down. He couldn’t picture her accepting his feelings, but he could easily imagine her laughing, maybe even telling Sydero later and the two of them laughing over drinks about it.

			Much to his dismay, he was starting to see the group as his family. Bradley, the annoying little brother, Sydero, the sister with an attitude, and $name, the friend that he had yet to confess his feelings to. He was going to tell her that night while he was messing with her car. That was the real reason behind him messing with it anyway. He was considerably lucky that his grandfather had taken the time to teach him those skills. The moment was right, they were alone, and he had a good feeling that if Sydero happened upon them, she would dash off before they even knew she was there. She wasn’t a complete asshole … at times. He hadn’t gone over what he was going to tell her, he was going to wing that part. And somewhere along the line, probably end up putting his foot in his mouth with either sounding stupid or saying the completely wrong thing. But his feelings would be out.
				
			He pushed his hair out of his face as he thought how she might take it, hopefully, she wouldn’t just laugh, pat his shoulder, and walk off. He couldn’t count how many times he’s gone to sleep with her face haunting his dreams. Every dream she was in was a fantasy, a pleasant dream that made him abhor waking up. And the only thing making him actually open his eyes, the understanding that she was somewhere close. And he prayed that when he opened his eyes, that the first thing he would see was that sexy, stunning, wondrous smile of hers. A smile that made all the darkness go away that could sway even the most malevolent of monsters.
				
			He swooned, almost forgetting where he was and what he was doing. Almost causing him to forget that none of that would ever happen. Because one little interruption had him back to doubting. //Maybe we’re not meant to be// and //maybe God is trying to tell me something.// These thoughts had rushed through his mind and had yet to fully get out. And so, he chickened out. And even if, by some odd miracle, he got his balls back, he might never see her again. His best friend could be gone forever.
				
			No! He wouldn’t believe it until he saw it. He needed to find them, not mope on some dusty motel step.

			Much to his dismay, he was starting to see the group as his family. Bradley, the annoying little brother, Sydero, the sister with an attitude, and $name, the friend that he was having a hard time forgiving, yet desperately wanted to. But only because why shouldn’t he? $name’s deeds had nothing to do with him ... He just ... ugh, why wasn’t this natural for him? He easily understood that who $name slept with was $his own business, and that was the end of it. Chris shouldn’t care, nor should he still be harboring feelings against it. So, why did he care? Why was it that every time he saw $name, his heart quaked in pain? Why did his anxieties cling so tightly to the idea that if $name slept with another, then it should be proof that nothing was there? Why did he want something to be there!

			This wasn’t the time, Chris knew that, but he couldn’t help it. This had been bugging him since they had got to Sydero’s safehouse and $name had tried to make some passes towards him. The more $he flirted, the more Chris wondered. And every time his thoughts got too far away from him, he heard his father’s voice. He heard his father condemning him to the deepest pit in hell. He saw his mother crying and turning her back to him.

			Chris ran his hands through his already disheveled hair. The only good thing about everyone missing was that he had a valid reason not to do this. Not to, once again, question his sexuality. Chris just needed to find his friend and his family.

			Much to his dismay, he was starting to see the group as his family. Bradley, the annoying little brother, Sydero, the sister with an attitude, and $name, the friend that he was really starting to doubt things about. Like Syd said, it was obvious that $name liked him, and he wasn’t too blind or stupid not to notice that. But it was always the simple, understandable fact that he didn’t like $him, or not so much of $him as much as … his gender. And each time he said that classic line of his, well he felt himself believing it less. His dad had a screwed up mind, so why was he acting like he had the same trait? He had no problem with gay people, but did he if he refused to even believe that he could be that? 
			
			“You sound like one of those guys that say they have gay friends and can therefore say homophobic shit,” he chuckles to himself. He wondered if any of those guys ever just stopped and wondered too. Or if they were just //that// comfortable. He wished he was already pan-sexual, it would make this a whole lot easier, though his parents would hate him the same. Every time he even thought about what could be interpreted as a gay thought, his parent’s voices echoed in his mind, reminding him that he was no sinner. But he was no saint either, and like Sydero had once mentioned, “if you’re not a saint, then might as well have some fun and be a sinner.” He was quoting Sydero now, that was great.
			
			Ugh, he just wanted his group back. Right now wasn’t the time to doubt his sexuality.

	Much to his dismay, he was starting to see the group as his family. Bradley, the annoying little brother, Sydero, the sister with an attitude, and $name, the best friend that always ended up in a heap of trouble. He should put trackers on all of them, each and every last one of them. He was actually getting upset. How dare they leave the least experienced alone? This was going to be a repeat of every other time, and all of them was going to have to come save him. He had no clue what to do, he just knew he needed to find the others.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

He had a feeling that the cops grabbed $name, but he felt like something even worse had happened. That plan wasn’t perfect, no plan ever is. But what happened shouldn’t have. Something had to have occurred, especially since he was met by demons further in. Something that made a meager plan go straight to hell.

With a not yet defeated sigh, Chris rose to his feet and dashed into the motel’s lobby, coming out later after calling a uber and knowing that he needed to get to a gas station and a fast food restaurant.

I try to steady myself, but it’s impossible and when I look around the small cell, I realize why I’m feeling such a way.

“Wakey wakey,” the Entity chuckles, resting their head on the concrete wall, sighing happily.

“What the hell do you want?” I question, scowling as I sit up. I tell myself to send them away, but they don’t, in fact, they laugh at the attempt.

&lt;&lt;if $entitytakeover&gt;&gt;\

Of course, you could fight me and try to cast me out, but you’d only get brain damage. Stuck with me now.” They go to the cell’s bars and tap them, creating an irritating chime with each tap.
	
	“Gloating, are we?” I ask.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“I’m part of you remember? I could go into that brain of yours right now and torture you, make you watch things you’ve never even imagined. That’s how much power I have over you.” They go to the cell’s bars and tap them, creating an irritating chime with each tap.
	
	“Gloating, are we?” I ask.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“Hey, buddy?” a new voice asks, I’m guessing the guy in the cell across from me, “are you stupid or something?”

&lt;&lt;if $honesty &gt;= 50&gt;&gt;\
	“No, just drunk,” I tell him, and for a minute there’s a long pause, “you been in here for like an entire day, how you drunk?”

	The Entity laughs at that, shaking their head as they turn to me, leaning on the bar, “can’t even lie to a drunk. You really are pathetic.”
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“No, you’re still drunk,” I tell him, and I hear him huff in acceptance, and his mat creak.
	
	“Round of applause for you, Roe, fooling the local drunk. You’re doing big things, huh?”
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“I could get you out of here,” they say, not looking at me, still looking out and down the hallway. “Would be easy too.”

“Really?” I question, and they turn to me, shocked that I even had to ask.

“Of course,” I felt the punchline, I knew it was coming, just didn’t know what it would be, “but I won’t.” They prance over to the farthest corner, sitting happily. “I kinda like the idea of Prison Roe. Means that you’re not running around with that mismatched group of yours and you’re stuck in one place. The only thing you have to worry about now is which group to hang out with and which group needs a good shanking. Never thought I would say this, but I’m on Langston and Petri’s side.”

“If I win, I get full control. You’re going to be taking a backseat to your own life, only gaining control when //I// want you to have it. All to make sure you’re a good little pet for the day everything happens.” That was a pretty big prize, and I doubt anything I wanted would even touch that.

“Then you give me the truth about you, and what happened //that// night. And about what’s so damn important I sit back and wait for. I want the truth about everything.” The Entity hums to themselves as they walk the length of the cell, pacing back and forth.

“Alright, deal.” They extend their hand towards me with a mischievous smirk, “can only seal this with a shake.” I stare at the hand that’s actually just a smoky tendril.

“It doesn’t even matter,” I decide to tell them, “I’ll be getting out of here soon enough.” That causes the Entity to burst out laughing, so hard that I have to turn and face them, thinking that they were going to die from it.

&lt;&lt;if $optimism &gt;= 50&gt;&gt;\
	“Well, you have always been the optimistic one, huh. Guess it’s a hard pill to swallow that you’re on your own now. Your group has their own problems to deal with.”
	
	“What do you mean?” I ask, wanting to know if they knew anything.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“$name, be honest with me, do you even believe that? Do you really think that that group is coming for you?”
	
	“Why?” I ask, wanting to know if they knew anything.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“Well let’s see, Chris is in the wind. Even he doesn’t know where he is or what’s going on. And we all know that poor defenseless Chris can’t stand on his own. He’ll be dead within the hour. Then there’s that little hairless monkey, he has your car, and the only thing he can do is cry. Seems being smart can only go so far, and we definitely know he’ll die, maybe by a pack of werewolves? And finally, that pest, Sydero. Well, Raum is handling her. I despise demons, but I must thank him one day.”

They continue to talk, but I’m no longer listening, thinking about my team and what could possibly be happening. Did they even know where I was?

“They’ll come,” I mumble, squeezing my eyes shut, I just wanted to sleep.

“Want to bet on that?” the Entity whispers into my ear, I turn to gaze at them, seeing that they were serious.

“What’s the prizes?”

The Entity smiles that horrible cartoonish grin of theirs, the grin spreading across the majority of the mass intended to be their face.

“If I win, I get full control. You’re going to be taking a backseat to your own life, only gaining control when //I// want you to have it. All to make sure you’re a good little pet for the day everything happens.” That was a pretty big prize, and I doubt anything I wanted would even touch that.

“And if I win, you leave, period.”

The Entity shakes their head, “as much fun as that sounds, no can do.”

I reach out and shake the tendril, as soon as my hand touches it, the Entity moves back and laughs loudly.

“Oh, $name, you make this so easy. How much fun this will be. Maybe you’ll finally learn how to be a good pet.” Before I can question them further on that, they disappear. Whether they were back in my head or not, I don’t know. 

“Roe!” a booming voice shouts, and I feel a pain in my stomach as something connects. Suddenly my world is filled with light, and I realize it’s because it’s day time. Petri stands in front of me with Langston to the side, both of them glaring at me. I hear distant laughter.

“How many times I got to call your damn name? Huh?” Petri shouts, and I involuntarily wipe the spit that lands on my face away.

“What do you want?” I ask. Petri points to the breakfast tray, or what I suppose is supposed to be breakfast, sitting right beside me. Some kind of liquid, some hastily made grits, toast that was practically bread, and two horribly shaped sausages. Just staring at the food made me want to vomit.

“You eat it, or I’ll take you out back and show you how werewolves play with their food,” Petri growls, grabbing my shirt and then letting me go with a harsh shove.

“I know you didn’t mean for that to sound weird, but it definitely did,” Langston adds, gaining Petri’s ire. The two of them go back and forth, insulting one another as they leave the front of my cell and then walk out of view.

I really was in deep. Not only was I captured, but it wasn’t just by some regular cops, but by Petri and Langston. I’ve fought werewolves before, but that was with backup and with a weapon. I was unarmed and had a lack of backup. And I’ve never fought a shapeshifter, not sure if they were much different than fighting a regular human, or if they too had enhancements.

I’m taken out of my thoughts by another figure standing at my cell. I look up to see a man that I haven’t noticed since the start of my stay. Judging by his uniform, I can tell that he’s an officer of the station, and either he doesn’t get out much, or he’s new. He’s eating something, fruit snacks maybe, and he’s smacking on them as if they were the best thing in the world. Kinda was making me want some.

I shake my head and retreat further onto the bed. The Entity steps back and narrows their eyes but they don’t say anything else, they just vanish.

He shrugs nonchalantly, “not like you’re going to ever know what the outside of a jail looks like ever again.” I don’t have time to answer him as he walks away from the cell.

Time ticks by and though I didn’t have a clock to stare at, I did have a window that proved the passage of time. Breakfast turns into lunch, and I could see how one could practically feel themselves wither away. What if the Entity was right? If my group was long gone, and the only thing I had to look forward to was a road trip back to Virginia?

Prison. I could be going to jail. I was going to go on trial for something I didn&#39;t do and never see freedom again. All because ... I helped Sydero. No good deed goes unpunished.

I didn’t know many prison blues, only one I could actually think about was Johnny Cash’s, “Folsom Prison Blues,” and even those lyrics escaped me. So, I just think about the most cliché blues beat I can imagine and start belching out words, hitting the bars to help me out.

“Now, I haven’t done nothing wrong,” I shout, “regardless of what all those fancy folks say. They said I murdered cops, but I’m telling you there just ain’t no way.”

“I wanna be free! Taste the air, smell the flowers, I don’t really care. I just wanna be free! Do I care how? Just get me out from behind these prison bars because this is not my ... style?” That part had me stop. Well, there was a reason I wasn’t some famous blues singer. It was sad, to not even be told to shut up before you annoy yourself.

Surprisingly, no one comes running to see what I need, and only Jeff, my drunken partner across from me, stares at me in horror. I do it again, and then a third time. I’m about to do it a fourth when I hear Petri yell at me to shut up before he makes me. Seeing that he was probably itching to do so, I actually do hush.

Minutes continue to tick by, and I realize that I would have another day of just this, of just laying back and rethinking each and every decision I’ve ever made. I wasn’t even in prison yet and I was already sick of it. At least there I would get more interaction, though that doesn’t make me feel much better. Having two cops under my belt meant I was going to the type of prison that killers resided in. The guards would have it out for me and seeing that I really wasn’t //that// type of killer, I probably wouldn’t fit in very well.

I hear someone cough and look over to see Jeff finally sitting up on his bed.

“Hey,” I begin, “what are you in here for anyway, Jeff?”

He looks at me but doesn’t answer, coughing again, “drunken and disorderly content. Snuck up behind the sheriff and pissed on him.” He laughs at that, almost falling off his small mat. But he soon goes into another coughing fit, calming back down. 

“Huh, and how long are you staying?”

“Until my court date next week. But then I’ll be back, they’ll give me bond.”

“Can’t pay it?”

“Me? Naw, all my money is represented in the number of empty bottles at my apartment, and the apartment itself, I guess. My paycheck goes to two things.” He raises two fingers when he says it, spitting on the ground as he rests his head on the wall near his mat. “And I don’t have anyone who cares for me so, yea, there goes that.”

“No one? No friends at all?” I find it hard to believe, even the movies with the town drunk had at least one friend, even if it turned out to just be some annoying, inquisitive kid.

“Nope, everyone’s given up on me. Said I wouldn’t be nothing more than a piss poor drunk, and guess what? They were right!” He laughs, but it’s a sad one. A laugh that said he didn’t care much anymore only because he’s heard it so many times, from so many people.

“What about you?” he asks, standing and coming to the bars, he gives me a closer inspection, “you don’t look like no cop killer.”

“Looks can be deceiving,” I say plainly, and he laughs at that one.

“No, they ain’t.” I don’t know what I expected his reply to be, but it wasn’t that. I turn my full attention to him as he gestures to himself, “I look like a piss poor drunk. Am I wrong?”

“One person doesn’t count,” I mumble, but Jeff doesn’t stop. He points down the hall, and after a lot of leaning, I see he’s pointing at Langston and Petri.

“They look like two crooked cops with a whole lot of secrets, am I wrong?” Well ... He then points at the sheriff who’s walking around with a donut, “and he just looks like a donut-loving cop.”

“And what do I look like?” I ask, relaxing again, curious to see what he would say. He looks me up and down.

“You look like a kid who’s in way over $his head.” Well, that proves it, Jeff is the smartest guy alive.

I chuckle and sigh, “you’re not as stupid as you look, Jeff.”

“Ah, yes I am,” he replies, curling up on his mat, “especially since the only thing I want to do right now is grab another bottle and chug it. Like I said, there ain’t no fancy tricks. Not some, look deeper bullshit. Sometimes,” I barely hear his next words as I hypothesize that he’s falling asleep, “a bird is just a bird. A cat is just a cat, and the local drunk just likes his bottles.”

“Oh, hoy, so you innocent, huh? Aren’t we all?” he laughs, but I don’t laugh with him.

“I am innocent,” I tell him. Jeff quiets down, running his hands through his long dark grayed beard. He presses his face to the bars, and I can’t help but wonder if he’s still a tad bit drunk.

	“Really? Maybe, I’m just a good liar?”
	
	“Yea, maybe. But ya ain’t.” I watch as Jeff goes back over to his bed.
	
	“And how would you know, you’re nothing but the town’s drunk.”

	“Exactly, and that title holds all my credentials. A liar knows a liar,” he points out. He lays down on his mat and then leans forward to look at me. “You know how many times I said I’ll stop, kid? How many times I looked my ma in the eye and said, ‘that was my last one?’ My ma was buried with that lie.” He snorts as he lays back down, “turned up at the old woman’s funeral drunk.”

	“Shame,” I sigh quietly, the only noise coming from the officers further down, talking and typing up their various reports.

	“Ain’t nothing wrong with being honest, kid,” he murmurs from his spot, his voice sounding as if it was fading out, probably due to him falling asleep, “I’d give my last bottle for that trait.”

	I snort to myself, “was that a lie?” He never responds, but he does chuckle softly.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“I believe ya,” he tells me, and I actually cock my head to the side in shock, “sike!” He shouts, slapping his leg as he rocks back and forth, laughing at his own joke.

	“You’re just a drunk, what makes you think I care what you think?” I ask, and he shrugs earnestly.

	“Yea, I’m just a dirty old drunk, but at least I accept it. I don’t walk around saying I’m the King of Norway.” I watch as Jeff goes back over to his bed, falling onto it and still laughing.
	
	“And how would you know I’m lying?”

	“You already answered your own question, kid. A liar knows a liar,” he points out. He lays down on his mat and then leans forward to look at me. “You know how many times I said I’ll stop? How many times I looked my ma in the eye and said, ‘that was my last one?’ My ma was buried with that lie.” He snorts as he lays back down, “turned up at the old woman’s funeral drunk.”

	“You got a gift, kid, embrace it,” he murmurs from his spot, his voice sounding as if it was fading out, probably due to him falling asleep, “most folks can’t lie to save their own ass.”

	I snort to myself, “who’d you think would win in a lying contest, old man, me or you?” He never responds, but he does chuckle softly, and I swear I hear him say, “you can’t beat a pro.”

One wrong move and everything just crashes down. No good deed goes unpunished.”

I hear him snort and look over to see him laughing from his spot on the mat, “well, duh. Because their ain’t no such thing as a good deed.” I raise a brow at that.

“Yes, there is.”

“No there isn’t, ya idiot,” he replies. He sees the flicker of doubt cross my face again and smack his lips, staggering to the bars, “tell me. Why did you do this good deed?”

“I wanted to help someone who needed helping, it was the right thing.”

“And what would’ve happened if you just didn’t do it? Would it have bothered you? Haunted you forever?”

“Maybe, kinda? I don’t know.”

“Listen, kid. Everyone does something because they get something out of it. Sheriff over there saves some random cat from a tree, he doesn’t do it out of the goodness of his heart, but because someone somewhere is going to appreciate the random stranger that did it. And if not that, then he does it to make himself feel better. He gets a warm tingly feeling ... kinda how I do when I gotta piss.” I stare in disgust but that doesn’t seem to bother him, I doubt it would since I saw the man lying in his own throw up when I first got here.

“Point is, whether we do it for that warm feeling or for a thank you, there’s intention.”

“Great, doesn’t help me. Only makes me feel stupider.”

He shrugs and walks back to his mat, “every time I end up in this cell, I feel stupid. But not because I was drinking, but because I got caught.” I think on his words, trying to figure them out.

“Are you trying to say that I wouldn’t have regretted anything if I hadn’t been caught? That this moment right here, is the only reason why I’m rethinking everything?” I never receive an answer, unless a small snore is his way of replying.

He scarfs it down, finishing his and mine in record time. I walk up to the bars, grabbing Langston’s attention.

“Hey! When is my phone call?”

“What does this look like? A Hollywood movie, those aren’t real,” he snorts, lazily kicking his feet up on the desk.

“Come on. I’m never going to taste freedom again, let me have this.”

“How stupid do you think I am, Roe? You’re just going to call your group and try to get out of this.”

Do you doubt your own plan?” That seems to get Langston’s attention, and he sits up, carefully peering at me. A lot could be said about Langston, but I could see that calling him stupid wasn’t one of them.

“You know what, sure. One phone call, you better hope they pick up.” I think the last part is a warning until I see the smirk on his lips, it was more of a challenge. He grabs me and walks me to the phone.

I call Bradley’s phone, begging he’ll pick up. The rings drag on until I finally hear them stop, my heart soaring.

“$name!” I hear Bradley shout, relief in his voice and my heart.

“Oh finally! Bradley, are you okay?” I ask, peering at Langston who taps his watch.

“Yea, I’m fine. I have our stuff and everything ... are you in?”

“Jail? Yes! With my supernatural escorts too. Please tell me you’re devising a plan.” Silence. “Bradley!”

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“I’m sorry,” he squeaks, “Sydero is gone, and I have no idea where. And Chris, I can’t find him either. I’ve been searching everywhere. He’s not picking up my calls and when I stopped at the motel again, he wasn’t there.”
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“I’m sorry,” he squeaks, “Sydero is gone, and I have no idea where. I’ve been searching everywhere, ever since we all got separated.”
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“Then you come,” I try, knowing that that wasn’t going to happen even before the words fully leave my mouth.

“Yea, because both of us should go to jail, together, of course.”

“Bradley ... what are you saying right now.”

Sydero managed to get back to her feet, albeit unsteadily. She felt drunk, her body fighting on two fronts and both were a lost cause.

“Come on, Sydero, go ahead and give in. You’re fighting a losing battle,” Raum chuckles, holding up a strange charm to her. Sydero narrows her eyes on it, realizing exactly what that charm was and what it was doing. It’s been so long since she’s seen one of its kind, but her memories regarding it were not friendly. //This really is a losing battle//, she thought to herself. She needed to get out of here, but part of her found that to be stupid. She could run, and Raum would just locate her again, no problem. Using most of her energy, she gets to her feet and darts away, sliding behind a pair of trashcans to hide herself.

“How much energy do you think you have now?” Raum questions, walking past her current hiding spot unbeknownst. She was asking herself the same question. It wasn’t much, and that’s what she was afraid of. That book ordeal really had zapped much of her remaining energy. Leaving her scrounging among the bottom of a mostly dry barrel for anything more. It was a shame that Raum knew this as well.

Suddenly, her body was launched through the air, skidding across the gravel road as she slowly came to a stop. Her entire left side ached, she felt like one big bruise.

“To think, once you would’ve seen that coming, avoided it, and killed me in all one strike,” he recounts, stopping at her side. She was going to die here, or worse, get captured and brought back to his employer, whoever that was. She had one thought but failed to see why he would need to hire a bounty hunter, to come and get her.

This was a losing battle. She wouldn’t make it past this moment.

But ... Roe needed her. She needed to save herself. The thought of Bradley finding her either dead or gone, surfaced. That thought alone caused her insides to transform, stroking a fire that hasn’t been seen to in forever, began to relight itself. Her body quakes as it consumes her, part of her fighting to calm it back down. It was a natural response now. Keep the beast inside, she would tell herself, but it was too late for that.

The beast woke up, and it consumed her.

Hearing your thought said aloud by another made it ten times worse. Just thinking it was bad enough, but when another party entirely confirms those very same thoughts, it just brought the world crashing around you. It caused you to sit back quietly and just think. But that was the hilarious part, your mind wasn’t really focusing on anything but the words they said. You replay them time and time again until they make sense, but they never do. Part of you still fights, trying not to believe, while the other part laughs, saying it already knew that to be the answer.

In my case, I sit, staring at a stained grey wall, trying to envision a colorless future.

&lt;&lt;link [img[images/divider.png]] &gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/link&gt;&gt;
Bradley hung up the phone and wiped his eye, knowing that it was growing red in the corners and that bags were developing under his eyes. He once thought himself immune to dark circles but looking in the mirror now changed his mind. He’s gone longer than this without sleeping, but he’s never worried this bad either.

Every two minutes he was refreshing his laptop, hoping for a dot to appear to say that he was successfully able to trace his group&#39;s cellphone signal. The only location he knew was $name’s, but $his location wasn’t the easiest. Bradley thought about just driving the car into the prison, but he was pretty sure that was a stupid idea. And yet, here he was, rethinking it.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“Damnit Chris, how hard is it to find an outlet and charge your phone up?” he asks himself, more than anyone else. If his suspicions were correct, then Sydero was far too busy to check her phone. But Chris, besides maybe being lost, he should’ve already called him.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

He no longer knew what to do, besides slump back in his seat and complain about how horrible his life was. Yea, feeling sorry for himself seemed like the smart thing to do. Maybe he should order another milkshake, question the server about what was life and the meaning of it.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	Bradley was so down that he almost didn’t register the new light on his laptop’s screen, an overview of the town. It was moving every four minutes, but it was there, blinking repeatedly. Joy rushed through Bradley’s bones, Chris.
	
	“I found Chris!”
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

[[Continue-&gt;LP3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1314" name="LP3" tags="" position="2929,5001" size="100,100">I stare up at the ceiling, half of me listening to Jeff’s ramblings while the other half is focused on nothing, not really anyway.

“Come clean up my piss!” Jeff hollers, and I look over to see that it was just his dried up throw up on the floor. I surmise that he was just trying to find something, or someone, to occupy his time. “And where’s my damn water?”

“Mr. Clark, this is not a hotel, it’s a sheriff’s office,” one of the uniformed officers say, walking by. He spares me a glance, but most of his attention is on Jeff who continues to hoot and holler about the treatment. When the officer walks away, Jeff grabs my attention and bursts out laughing, causing me to chuckle. But my spirit was gone. In two days, I’ll be introducing myself to my cellmate, hoping they weren’t as horrible as entertainment sources say they are. Maybe I’ll get someone like Jeff, just sober and more manners, hopefully.

I’m still lying down when two cops abruptly rush by, their radios going off with people shouting on the other side. I get up and try to steal a peek at what’s going on, failing when I can’t see anything.

“You know what’s going on, Jeff?” I question, pressing myself as close as I can to the bars. I can hear shouting, and at some points, I even think I hear Langston and Petri discussing something, but that’s it.

“Nope,” he answers, “and I still want my damn water.” I ignore Jeff, trying even harder to hear what was going on.

“Move that prisoner now,” I hear Langston shout, “I don’t care about the others, just get Roe.” A shaking officer appears, in his hands the keys to my cell. Gunshots go off in the distance, causing all of us to jump in shock. The officer begins to cry, tears running down his face as he tries to unlock the gate.

[[Grab his arm.]]

[[Wait till he opens it.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1315" name="Grab his arm." tags="" position="2822,5104" size="100,100">I grab his arm, pulling him towards me and causing him to ram right into the cell’s bars. His forehead collides with the bars, and as soon as I let him go, he’s on the ground, groaning in pain. With the keys now in my hands, I get to work on unlocking my cell.

“Woo-wee, you gonna let me out next, right?” Jeff asks, tapping his lock, giving me an almost smug look. I look from him to his lock.

“Fuck outta here!” I scream at the guy, and he doesn’t need to be told twice. The man immediately runs away, sobbing about how he doesn’t want to die and how he has a family, the usual. I position myself by the gate, trying out the various keys until I get to the right one.

“Woo-wee, you gonna let me out next, right?” Jeff asks, tapping his lock, giving me an almost smug look. I look from him to his lock.

I roll my eyes but unlock his cell.

“Exit is this way, compadre,” Jeff states, running the opposite way, away from whatever is going on. Knowing that this is probably my rescue, I wave Jeff off. He doesn’t seem to be bothered, he just goes right on his way, waving me off.

I continue heading towards the central area when an officer rounds the corner, eyes widening when he sees me.

[[Pretend to beg for help.]]
[[Immediately attack.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1319" name="LPKG" tags="" position="2919,5311" size="100,100">“Sorry, Jeff,” I say, shrugging my shoulders as I continue along my way. I expect to be bombarded with some curses and phrases that only a drunk like Jeff can think up, but instead, he just says goodbye. Though I refused to let him out, I have a feeling that Jeff can let himself out. Either that or he was just going to go back to sleep.

I continue heading towards the central area when an officer rounds the corner, eyes widening when he sees me.

I hardly had any energy, thanks to not eating much and sleep being the worst thing ever on that mat. But the punch knocks the man out, and I follow the sound of screams and shouts.

The lights overhead flicker on and off as I navigate my way through the station, finding the storage room and grabbing my phone, wallet, and bookbag. I set out once again, sprinting down the hall and turning.

He hits the floor with a loud thud, and I deliver punch after punch, my movement slowing as my energy wanes considerably. I know I hadn’t eaten much but dang. Thankfully, the punches do their job, and the man lays still. After making sure he won’t follow, I go and follow the sound of screams and shouts.

I cock my head to the side, as if the angle would allow me to see the scene differently, paint a new one that made much more sense. Sydero gazes over at me, the brightest of the red’s in her eyes seem to swim, like a predator lurking through a bloody ocean. Her eyes move from me to the figure which she has by the neck, their blood covering her hands like a glove. 

The once living man was no longer identifiable. His face was contorted in an assortment of ‘creative’ ways, all which had been dealt by the hand of Sydero. He looks less like a man, and more like a creature. Someone whose face had gotten jumbled up by a blender and then was forgotten where each feature was supposed to sit. I’ve seen my share of death, but up this close, and knowing the person who had done it, it causes bile to rise.

“And now you know,” Sydero chuckles, disrespecting the body further by lazily tossing it away. She looks at her fingertips in disgust. This woman, this thing … this wasn’t Sydero. Or maybe that’s just it, this was her. The woman I knew, wasn’t. “I hope this reaffirms the lesson I tried to teach you about trusting people.” Her tone was laidback, not matching the dire situation and her current predicament.

“Sydero,” is all I find myself saying, my words still being held hostage in my throat. They didn’t even feel like my words.

“Should’ve walked away when you could,” she adds with a yawn, turning her back to me as she observes her work. I don’t know for sure, but what looks to be six individual officers rests around us, each looking more mangled than the last.

“What the hell are you?” I question, though a piece of me already knows, can already figure it out. Everything, from her behavior to her words, to her entire appearance, screams the same thing to me.

She turns and gives me a wicked toothy grin, “don’t you know a demon when you see one?”

“To start,” Bradley begins, looking from Syd to me, “I knew what she was.”

“I figured that much out. You didn&#39;t seem exactly shocked at the demon part.” I state.

&lt;&lt;link [img[images/divider.png]] &gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/link&gt;&gt;
“We don’t know where Raum is or what he’s planning,” Sydero reminds us.

“Did he let anything slip when he was attacking you?” I ask, and she shakes her head.

“All he said was that he was done playing games and that all of this was about to end.”

“So he’s making his move soon,” I sigh, “but that’s all we got. We don’t know where he is, what he’s planning, or anything really.”

“There might be a way,” Sydero says, standing and going into the kitchen. She comes back out with her bowl and sets it down on the coffee table.

&lt;&lt;link [img[images/divider.png]] &gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/link&gt;&gt;
I’m about to continue practicing when a sullen wind rolls in, and with it a putrid aroma. I spot a dark mist on the horizon, getting closer and closer to our current location.

I stand in silence. I wouldn’t have believed her if it wasn’t for her current appearance. She still looked like Sydero, skin tone, hair color, clothing. All of that was still her. But what wasn’t Sydero was the pair of garnet colored demonic wings that stick out of her back. The wing’s thumb was a wicked sharp claw that dripped blood onto Sydero’s shoulder. On her head, her black curly locks hiding their origins, were two medium-sized horns that curl up at the last minute into a rounded point. And lastly, there was a crimson mist that almost seemed to leak off of her, in smoky wisps.

I place my hand on the station’s lobby desk, trying to balance myself and calm my trembling.

&lt;&lt;if $nerve &lt; 40&gt;&gt;\
	I take a deep breath and feel myself choke on the air. I begin coughing as my heart speeds up and my breathing picks up rapidly. I fall to the ground, placing my back up against the desk as my world seems to drift.
	
	“Get a hold of yourself, Roe,” I hear Sydero say, and see her walk by, stepping right onto the body resting in front of me. I hear the soft squishing and see the blood spatter. I was definitely going to throw up.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	I take a deep breath and tell myself to calm down, to gather myself even though I was literally standing in front of a full-fledged demon. I wonder if Raum actually had a different appearance as well, one that showed his true demonic form. I steady myself and look at Sydero whose attention is on the building. She runs her hands down one side, before then putting her focus on the other.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“Sydero?” I say again, breathless. She doesn’t say anything, continuing to go from one area to the next.

[[“Explain yourself, now!”]]
[[“I don’t even know where to begin.”]]

She rolls her eyes and goes back to peering around the station.

The smell of death was beginning to do so something to me, something that I wasn’t comfortable with. I knew what death was supposed to smell like, but at that moment, there was almost a sweetness to it. An intoxicating perfume that was attempting to pull me towards it.

I take another seat, this time on a nearby chair that was further away from the carnage.

“Bradley’s outside. Go with him,” Sydero commands, still not looking at me as she disappears down a hallway.

“What are you doing?” I ask, about to go after her when I spot a bright light nearby. I turn and see the fire spreading, enveloping everything along with it, I search for Sydero but only see other spots of fire. Eating away at the prison, determined to see it fall. I don’t know what’s going on anymore. I shake my head and flee outside, tearing my eyes at the other bodies that rest out here. I search, but I don’t see Langston’s or Petri’s body, possibly meaning that they got away. They were smarter than the other officers.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	Like Sydero said, I see my car pull up, and Bradley rushes out, throwing his arms around me as soon as he gets there. Chris is behind him, hugging me tightly as well.
	
	“We thought you were a goner,” he tells me.
	
	“Where the hell were you guys?”
	
	“Long story,” Chris tells me but my freak out has only just begun.
	I point at the police station that was slowly going up in flames with a trembling finger, “Sydero’s a damn demon!” Chris cocks his head in confusion, but I see the color drain from Bradley’s face.
	
	“What do you mean?” he asks nervously.
	
	“I mean she’s a demon! Wings, horns, the full shebang!” Before I can stop him, Bradley shoots towards the station, disappearing inside.

The smell of death was beginning to do so something to me, something that I wasn’t comfortable with. I knew what death was supposed to smell like, but at that moment, there was almost a sweetness to it. An intoxicating perfume that was attempting to pull me towards it.

I take another seat, this time on a nearby chair that was further away from the carnage.

“Bradley’s outside. Go with him,” Sydero commands, still not looking at me as she disappears down a hallway.

“What are you doing?” I ask, about to go after her when I spot a bright light nearby. I turn and see the fire spreading, enveloping everything along with it, I search for Sydero but only see other spots of fire. Eating away at the prison, determined to see it fall. I don’t know what’s going on anymore. I shake my head and flee outside, tearing my eyes at the other bodies that rest out here. I search, but I don’t see Langston’s or Petri’s body, possibly meaning that they got away. They were smarter than the other officers.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	Like Sydero said, I see my car pull up, and Bradley rushes out, throwing his arms around me as soon as he gets there. Chris is behind him, hugging me tightly as well.
	
	“We thought you were a goner,” he tells me.
	
	“Where the hell were you guys?”
	
	“Long story,” Chris tells me but my freak out has only just begun.
	I point at the police station that was slowly going up in flames with a trembling finger, “Sydero’s a damn demon!” Chris cocks his head in confusion, but I see the color drain from Bradley’s face.
	
	“What do you mean?” he asks nervously.
	
	“I mean she’s a demon! Wings, horns, the full shebang!” Before I can stop him, Bradley shoots towards the station, disappearing inside. 
	
	“What’s going on!?” Chris screams, racing after Bradley.

It controls me, leading me closer to her. With all my might and most of the energy that I had left, I send my fist right at her. At the last minute she catches it, and furthering the disrespect is that she’s not even looking at me.

She smirks and without even a blink, releases me by slinging me to the other side of the room.

	I sigh and mustering up the rest of my energy, I follow them back into the building I’ve been trying to escape. I follow Chris, who follows Bradley, who seeks out a woman lost among the smoke.

	“Sydero!” I hear Bradley call out and I grab onto Chris, letting him lead me.

	“Bradley, we can’t stay here, it’s too much smoke,” Chris tells him, lunging forward to grab the boy but he skirts out of his reach.

	“Sydero!” Bradley screams louder this time. Chris tries again to grab Bradley, but the boy avoids him, consequently not seeing the falling beam until it was too late. Chris and I both surge forward at once, too late as Bradley screams out in pain.

	Panic surfaces inside me, but I can feel that this adrenaline rush is going to be short-lived, between the smoke and my waning energy, I didn’t have much time.

	“Hold on, Bradley,” I hear Chris say and he begins to kick the beam, to no avail. I hear the sounds of wings and feel the ground shake, looking to see Sydero’s figure walking towards us out of the fire. I move back, and after yelping in both surprise and shock, Chris rushes to my side. I watch as Sydero grabs and flings the beam to the side, seizing Bradley. Before my eyes, I watch as her horns begin to shrink and her wings fold in and then disappear into her back. Everything but her eyes shift.

	“Don’t just stand there, you dimwits, let’s go,” she growls, surging towards the exit with Bradley. Chris grabs me and helps me out and back into the car. I have so many questions, so many things I want answers to, but my body screams at me to sleep, and I do.

[[Back at the safehouse ...]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1329" name="Head to the car." tags="" position="106,6024" size="100,100">I was five seconds away from blacking out, my vision still swimming in murky waters. I unsteadily go to the car, getting in and practically melting into the seat as I’m surrounded by familiar smells.

The image of Sydero appears in my mind, causing me to shiver as I push myself deeper into the seat. I needed to center myself, otherwise I was going to be feeling this way all day. I then remember the lack of energy in my body and the fact that I probably just had an adrenaline rush. I was going to faint sometime soon probably, and who knows, maybe when I woke up, I would find that none of this happened. It was all a big misunderstanding and that the Entity was just making me see things.

I’m unable to think more about that when my vision officially goes out and everything feels miles away.

[[Back at the safehouse ...]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1330" name="Back at the safehouse ..." tags="" position="203,5703" size="100,100">I awake later, realizing that I’m in my bed back at the main safehouse. I look outside and see that it’s still day, but for all I know, it could be the next day. My headache is still very much present, and my body feels completely numb. I attempt to get to my feet, but immediately my legs begin to shake, forcing me to sit back down. I stretch and get my mind together, definitely considering taking up yoga or meditation later.

But that was a decision that could be put on hold, I wanted answers.

I leave the room and head towards the kitchen, hearing Sydero’s and Bradley’s voice.

[[Eavesdrop on the conversation.]]
[[Go right in.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1331" name="Eavesdrop on the conversation." tags="" position="210,5806" size="100,100">“... it’s just sooner, rather than later now,” I hear Sydero say, finishing off her sentence.

There’s a short pause before Bradley asks, “how are you feeling though?”

“Like shit, honestly. My body hurts, and that transformation was practically forced, so it wasn’t pure. It’s been so long that I don’t even know what to do now. I need to go burn some of this energy away. Do something to calm down.” Of friggin course, Bradley already knew.

I go forward, standing in the doorway and catching both of their attention. Bradley looks much better, seeing that there was actually color in his face. And though Sydero is looking at me, she seems so ready to look away.

Unlike last time, she allows the punch, staggering backward due to the impact. She says nothing, gathering up a wad of blood and spitting it out into the sink, and then massages her jaw. Good, it hurt at least. Otherwise, my knuckles were in pain for no reason.

“Eat,” Bradley tells me, and I shake my head, pointing an accusing finger at Sydero.

“I want answers.”

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“And you’ll get em when Chris gets up. I’m not repeating myself,” she says matter-of-factly.	
	
	“You will if you need to,” I warn her, “if I ask the same question twenty times, you better answer it twenty times.” Sydero closes her eyes, and I see that mist rolling off of her as her body shakes.

“Calm down, $name,” Bradley tells me, “she’s still fighting the demonic side.”

“What does that even mean?!”

“Eat,” he orders again, pushing a bowl of oatmeal in front of me and taking on a sharper tone with me. I grumble but does as he says, mostly because my stomach was preparing to wage war.

	I devour the oatmeal, proving that I was as hungry as they thought I was. The good thing is that as soon as I finish, Chris enters, taking a seat and staring straight at a silent Sydero. She stands in the corner, refusing to look at any of us, finding odd entertainment with the peeling wallpaper beside her.
	
	“To start,” Bradley begins, looking from Syd to Chris and me, “I knew she what she was.”

	“You knew she was a demon?” Chris asks and before Bradley can answer, Sydero pipes up.
	
	“I’m not a demon. I’m a special little mutt.”
	
	“She’s a cambion,” Bradley further explains after rolling his eyes, “half human, half demon.”
	
	“It’s still a fucking demon!” Chris shouts, getting up and pacing around the small kitchen area.
	
	“Why didn’t you tell us to begin with?” I question, and with a straight face, Sydero points at Chris who looks ready to have an aneurysm. Okay, so she had a point there, we probably were going to panic, especially since she told me she was a witch on the first day. Would I even have agreed to travel with her if I had known what she really was?

“What did Bradley mean earlier about your demonic side?” I ask.

“Cambions are divided into three groups: mortal, balanced, and demonic. If I was more mortal, then I couldn’t use my powers, but it means I’m in tune with my human side. Demonic is what you saw in the station, I’m the most powerful, but I can’t really control my actions, or shall I say I’m not the nicest person when I’m that way. Balanced is what you’ve been seeing but I was still fighting myself, which is why I never wanted to use my powers. More I use them, more I shift. But if I don’t use them at all, then I run the risk of going to the mortal side.”

“Seems like a horrible balancing game,” I point out and she nods her head.

	“Then why the hell is Raum and his gang still alive? And didn’t you almost get your ass handed to you by a werewolf?” Chris asks, and I could see that Sydero was fighting everything within her not to grab him by the throat.
	
	“Well, smartass, there’s limits and rules, I did say if everything lined up perfectly. Adding to that, I’ve been trying to conserve energy so I wouldn’t go all dark side.”

“The Antichrist isn’t what Hollywood makes it seem like,” Bradley quickly adds, “Antichrist is pretty much another name for cambions, and it’s not a child conceived by Lucifer and a human, it’s any demon and human.”

“We’re rare, sure, but any other cambion could be called the Antichrist as well,” Sydero tells me.

“Yea, but it’s also the best thing to claim if you have any abilities and if you know spells at all. That, and my mom was a witch, so I guess in a way, I wasn’t totally lying.” I give her a look, and it’s the first time she smirks, shrugging her shoulders.

“So, did Hollywood get anything right when it comes to demons?”

She sighs and shakes her head in irritation, “let’s get this out of the way now. Demons can possess you but how Hollywood makes them seem is ridiculous. Demons, yes, we are naturally evil, but that doesn’t mean everything we do is. What I mean is that demons act differently, some just want to mess around, some want to ruin your life, some just want to get rich and embody the sins, and some just want to get laid. If you ask me, most demons aren’t any worse than humans.”

“Do exorcisms actually work?” I ask.

“Yep, and from what I heard, they hurt like hell and just piss the demon off. I’ve never been through it, for obvious reasons, but they say it feels like something is clawing your flesh away, dragging you into an inferno. So, it’s better to just kill them.”

A pit of desire that swallowed me whole, enticing every part of my body and soul.

	“I’m a succubus cambion,” she tells me, and for the first time, she doesn’t need to explain. I’ve seen enough movies to know what a succubus is, to know what they did, and the control they had over mortals.

	“So, this has all been a lie?” I ask, trying to wrap my mind around this new info.

	She snorts, rolling her eyes, “eh. I have enough control over my powers, typically. Though, I’m not going to sit here and say that you haven’t experienced them. It&#39;s always been by mistake though.” She looks away, playing with the edge of the table as she says the next part, “I’m not always able to control myself when I’m around you is all. But that’s why I keep telling you to leave it alone.” She says this as if putting the blame on me, though I can see in her eyes that she doesn’t believe it.

I decide to take a break, to stretch my legs and get some of that great southern sunshine. I grab my blade and check my gun, wondering if I would see anyone – wondering if I wanted to see anyone. I get out of the house without catching sight or hearing anyone. It almost feels weird, after everything that had happened. 

Once outside, I notice how beautiful a day it really is. The sun immediately wraps itself around me, wrapping me up in warmth. And just before one got too hot, the wind would rush by, cooling them down before promising its return. The colors of nature complement each other perfectly, from the sky to the trees, to the plants. A beautiful warm palette that was perfect for a temperate summer day. I glance upwards, watching as two dark grey and white birds fly by, flitting around one another playfully before diving towards the tree line.

I follow them, mindlessly walking through the woods, actually enjoying it.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	As I walk, I hear the sounds of someone grunting and make my way in that direction, curious to see what was going on. There I find Chris, high up in a tree and attempting to go even higher. At the base of the tree sits his discarded shirt – of course, it does. I approach, staring up and watching as he jumps from branch to branch. I surmise that his purpose was to improve his balance and strength, but then I suddenly see him fall purposely. He does an impressive roll upon touching the ground, and when he pops back up, there’s a gun in his hands, and he shoots a target on a far tree.
	
	“What was all that?” I question, my mind everywhere, trying to guess what he was doing.
	
	“Oh, $name,” Chris says in surprise, giving me a small smile and then looking at the target shyly. “I was just trying to practice my aim under duress.”
	
	“Any reason for that?” He grabs his shirt and wipes his sweaty forehead off, sighing as he sits down, staring off.
	
	“I’m the weak link here,” he states plainly.
	
	[[“Well duh.”]]
	[[“I think you forgot Bradley.”]]
	[[“Not really.”]]
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	The walk goes through most of the forest, taking me around a barely visible trail that I probably made on my own. I go past a sizeable pond, growing with each rainfall, yet diminishing on the hottest of days. I spot the deer family that lives in the area, no longer concerned over my presence. And then I even see the Blue Jay that Bradley has named Boo. She flies from her tree and hops across the ground, searching for nuts or acorns.

	It would seem that this forest is the only forest that doesn’t try to kill me; hopefully I hadn’t just jinxed everything.

	As I think this, I hear a branch snap and immediately regret everything until I see Bradley appear. In his hands is a bowl and as he approaches, I find that it’s eggs.

	“What are those for?” I question, and he points to Boo who is watching us now, or she’s actually just watching Bradley. A few seconds tick by before she flies to the bowl that Bradley holds, eating the egg there.

	“She loves eggs,” he tells me, softly petting her.

	“How many times have you done this?” I knew of Boo but had no idea that Bradley had made friends with her.

	“A couple times actually. It took a long time, but I think she trusts me now. It’s kinda cool.” His face lights up as he looks over at me but then it immediately dies, and he sighs as he slowly puts the bowl to the ground.

	“I know, I know, I should’ve told you about Syd a long time ago. And I’m sorry, but I’m not sorry, it wasn’t my place.”

“When I first got out of that museum, I was ambushed by demons. Now I know three demons is a lot, but I couldn’t do anything but run. They could’ve killed me, just like that,” he says and snaps his fingers. “I’m sure the reason they didn’t was that they didn’t think I was worth the effort or energy.”

“So you want to be worth killing?” I ask, and Chris rolls his eyes.

“No, I want to be able to defend myself and not immediately wish I had Sydero or $name by my side. I want to stand around the two of you and actually feel I have something to add.” He grows quiet, wiping his face again.

“So you want to be worth killing?” I ask, and Chris rolls his eyes.

“No, I want to be able to defend myself and not immediately wish I had Sydero or $name by my side. I want to stand around the two of you and actually feel I have something to add.” He grows quiet, wiping his face again.

“You and me both, The Lore is a really big book,” I laugh, and Chris joins in, “but I guess I see why we need it, especially if Bradley and Sydero aren’t there. Speaking of Sydero,” I say.

He’s about to shoot the target when he pauses, turning to me.

“Hey, I wanna show you something, let me see your gun.”

“Uh,” I start.

“Trust me, let me show you.” I sigh heavily and hand it over, watching as he checks my gun and then begins to shoot both of them. Impressively, he successfully aims at multiple targets and hits them, reminding me of some gunslinger superhero.

“Impressive,” I say, clapping slowly, “when you learn that?”

“Surprisingly, it was with Sydero. By the way, don’t show that woman you’re advanced unless you want her to hound you. I was training, and I guess she was trying to push me to do better by shouting at me and telling me how basic I am. I was supposed to try and shoot her, but she was using her powers to divert the rubber bullets each time. I ended up getting so pissed off and next thing I knew I was shooting at her with two guns. Should’ve seen her dancing,” Chris chuckles, handing me my gun back.

“Speaking of Sydero,” I say, and Chris sighs, nodding as he knew what was going to come next.

I go past a sizeable pond, growing with each rainfall, yet diminishing on the hottest of days. I spot the deer family that lives in the area, no longer concerned over my presence. And then I even see the Blue Jay that Bradley has named Boo. She flies from her tree and hops across the ground, searching for nuts or acorns.

It would seem that this forest is the only forest that doesn’t try to kill me; hopefully I hadn’t just jinxed everything.

As I think this, I hear a branch snap and immediately regret everything until I see Bradley appear. In his hands is a bowl and as he approaches, I find that it’s eggs.

“What are those for?” I question, and he points to Boo who is watching us now, or she’s actually just watching Bradley. A few seconds tick by before she flies to the bowl that Bradley holds, eating the egg there.

“She loves eggs,” he tells me, softly petting her.

“How many times have you done this?” I knew of Boo but had no idea that Bradley had made friends with her.

“A couple times actually. It took a long time, but I think she trusts me now. It’s kinda cool.” His face lights up as he looks over at me but then it immediately dies, and he sighs as he slowly puts the bowl to the ground.

“I know, I know, I should’ve told you about Syd a long time ago. And I’m sorry, but I’m not sorry, it wasn’t my place.”

“To make you a Bellini?”

	I chuckle and shake my head, “no, sorry. I’m still the better bartender between you and me.”
	
	“In your dreams,” he laughs, but the whole purpose of that was to get him smiling again.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	I chuckle and shrug my shoulders, “your Bellini’s are subpar, I was thinking of a Martini.”

	“What! You’re crazy, my Bellini’s are amazing,” he laughs, but the whole purpose of that was to get him smiling again.

	“It’s fine, Chris,” I say, trailing off. The apology wasn’t what bothered me, how does one bring up their feelings now, after that? ‘Oh and Chris, I like you a lot, and I’m sorry, but I want you.’ That would immediately bring up my actions, and why I did them and knowing my luck, it would just lead to another fight. The realization unsettles me, but I hide it as best I can.

	I give Chris a fake smile and tell him that I’m going to go back to walking. He says his farewells and lets me go.

		“Thanks, $name, it means a lot.”

		“I always say nice things to you,” I laugh, aching for him to put his hand back. These moments were a dime a dozen now, always ending the same. And yet, I still had the same wish for each of them, I still believe that they’ll end differently.

		“Well, I think I’m going to get back to training?” Chris asks, tapping my shoulder in a friendly manner before getting up. He walks away before pausing, turning back to me.

		“Actually, $name, I –” The forest becomes silent as if even it is holding its breath. I can feel my heart pounding, my eyes never straying from Chris’s. “I’m glad you’re okay.” A bird chirps angrily as it takes flight, drawing my eye as it breaks through the tree line and then out of sight.

		“Thanks,” I say, sighing and then getting up. I go slowly, thinking he’ll stop me again, thinking that this is it. But my feet keep going, and my hope keeps dwindling.

Chris chuckles at that, “yea, I guess I’m thinking there was some deep revelation or something.”

“Why?” I ask, feeling my heart speed up.

“Oh, it was just a question I always wondered about, you know?” I raise a brow, not believing it for a minute, but Chris obviously wasn’t about to lay his heart out in front of me.

“I’m going to practice more. I’ll see you later?” I nod, especially since we were living in the same house. With that, I continue my walk.

I couldn’t sit and lie to myself and keep telling myself that I wasn’t attracted to guys. One thing led to another, and here I am, confident in who I am and who I’m attracted to.”

“Your uncle never had something to say about it?” he asks, and I snort.

“My uncle was eating popcorn when I told him, as soon as I said that I was interested in guys he stared at me, threw a popcorn kernel at me, asked if I found Hugh Jackman attractive, and then we had a full conversation about our man crushes. So yea, he had a lot to say about it.” Chris seems impressed by that and thanks me, but also leaves it at that.

There were so many werewolves, and she couldn’t beat them all herself, and so she let the other side come out. The werewolves had no chance after that, it would’ve been smarter if they just killed themselves. After, I was terrified. She didn’t even try to reassure me, but I think that’s because she was still more demonic, she’s an incredible asshole when she’s tipping the scales closer to demonic. But yea, she told me, and I did my own research and, I guess I accepted it.”

It gets silent, but Bradley waves it away before it can get awkward, pulling out his phone.

“I’m going to head back to the house, I’ll see you later.” And with that, Bradley waves me away and begins his march back towards the house. I watch him leave, deciding to walk a little bit more before heading back myself.

I walk the rest of the trail, coming up on the back of the house when I see Sydero standing off to the side, her attention on the bowl.

“Might not want to get too close,” she says, and I notice the unemotional tone in which she says it, her eyes still on the bowl, “hellfire isn’t known for its tameness.” Before I can ask her what fire she’s talking about, the bowl erupts into dancing flames. I immediately see what she means as the fire rages more every second. The bowl disappears behind the curtain of flame that refuses to be contained. It’s wrath whips through the air, striking what looked to be nothing but capturing the oxygen to strengthen itself. Even though the fire was nowhere near me, I could feel it upon my skin, considering whether I should be its next victim.

“What are you doing?” I question, walking the farthest path to get to her.

“Cleansing the bowl. Only fire that can actually clean the damn thing is hellfire.”

“The same fire that you lit at the station?”

“Yes, though that flame was more controlled, all due to the,” she gestures to herself, “demonic side. This fire can only be controlled by a demon, I wouldn’t even be able to make it right now if I was truly balanced.”

I notice that she’s controlling it to a degree, which is why her attention has been on it mostly.

“Well, I no longer feel weak,” she says, “but I’m woozy. Like after taking five energy drinks and using up every bit of energy you have from it. It’s slowly going away, but that’s the worst part about this, I have to be so carefully balanced, or I risk going too far right, or too far left.”

“Seems like a lot,” I mention and though she doesn’t acknowledge me verbally, she does nod.

Sydero balls up her fist and the flames, though resilient against the command, begin to fizzle out and die. The bowl looks starkly different than the last time I saw it. All along the inside is writing, scripted and flowing from one line to the other, circling the entire bowl.

“It couldn’t have been that dirty, right? I mean that bowl was brown and now it’s practically white,” I point out.

“I put a spell on it a long time ago. For every hand that touches it that’s not mine, it becomes more and more unrecognizable. I did it to protect the writing in it. If even a small fraction of it is scratched, then the bowl’s usefulness disappears.” I catch sight of Sydero flexing her hand, and I notice the burnt skin there. She catches my eye, and for the first time, she looks embarrassed, slowly closing her fist back up.

“I need to remember how to use this power.”

“That’s what happens when you don’t know?” I question.

She nods, and to my surprise, she opens it up again, “I have scars worse than this. Each one with a lesson attached.”

I point to her newly acquired one, “what lesson did this one teach?”

“Control it or get burned as a consequence.” She walks over to the bowl and picks it up, turning it from one side to the other. She says nothing else as she heads back inside, and I follow close behind.

“Think about a scale numbered from zero to ten, zero is mortal, five is perfectly balanced, and ten being demonic. When we were traveling together, I was a five, sometimes a four or three. When I shifted, I was maybe an eight. And now I’m a seven.”

“So you’re still leaning more towards demonic right now, as long as you’re six through ten.” She nods, “so have you ever been at zero or a ten?”

“I’ve never been at zero. I’ve never been anything less than maybe a three. And I&#39;ve been a eight or nine.” Her eyes grow darker as she seems to think about something else. Suddenly the flame rages, threatening to grab hold of the nearby trees. Sydero comes back, and the fire calms only so much, growling at the idea of being controlled.

“Ugh, don’t remind me. That man was ready, which wasn’t so much of a surprise but how ready he was, was. He came after me with charms and tricks that I hadn’t seen in forever. Tricks only those from the 16th century knew about, some really dark and really scary stuff. As for Langston and Petri, both of them got out, immediately high-tailed and ran when I landed.

	“I’m sorry,” Bradley squeaks, darting out of the room and then coming back in later with a large wad of bandages. Sydero rolls her eyes but takes them from him, carefully grabbing my hand. She sends Chris to go get some water and the black candle from her room. Once she has everything, she begins.

“Are you ready?” she asks me, and I chuckle nervously.

&lt;&lt;if $SRomance &gt;= 6&gt;&gt;\
	“Not really, but I trust you,” I tell her. I watch as another look comes across her face. Surprise? Doubt? Confusion? I can’t really say, but I can feel her grip on my hand relax as she gently flattens my hand out. With one smooth move, she brings the blade across my palm, and I stiffen, awaiting a sense of pain that never hits. Instead, I feel as if nothing has happened whatsoever, yet when I look at my hand blood flows freely from it.

	Sydero rotates it and holds it over the bowl, squeezing so that the blood would come out faster.

	“It’s empathy,” Sydero whispers. Finally, something I knew about. Which actually made sense and only gave me more insight into the comprehensive list of abilities that she had. She was manipulating my emotions so much that the usual feeling of pain wasn’t being registered.

	Once done, she grabs the bandage and wraps my hand up. She looks up at me but doesn’t say anything, releasing me and putting her attention on the bowl. As soon as she lets me go, my rightful emotions come through. A mix of pain and the aftershock of terror hit me immediately. But it only lasts for a short while as the pressure of the bandage does its job.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“Is it even possible to be ready for this?” I ask, and she shrugs.

She says something in what I think is Latin, grabbing the burning candle and letting the wax drip into the bowl. I watch as it begins to bubble, first big ones but the more she speaks, the smaller the bubbles become and begin to rapidly appear. She dips her finger in as she speaks, stirring the ingredients. She stops and places her palm inside the bowl, and it disappears underneath a thick dark red liquid. I notice Sydero’s eyes have shifted into her demonic eyes and she stares at the wall directly in front of her, frozen.

“Petri, any news?” she asks, and though it is her talking, the voice that comes out is Raum’s. We all move in, curious.

“Well, tell me when they arrive, as soon as they do, we head to South Carolina to find them. You still have Roe’s location, correct?” There is a pause as I guess Petri responds. “Good. Langston and I will be grabbing the items needed for the portal, we have two days to do this. Anything goes wrong, and I will personally see the end to each of you.” Suddenly Sydero jumps, shaking her head as her eyes are once again amber orbs.

She rubs at her eyes and looks over at me.

“They’re tracking us through you somehow, any clue?” I shake my head as I think it through, not being able to think of anything.

“Think, $name, come on, when they captured you, do you remember anything that must’ve happened or something they did or pushed you to do?” Bradley asks.

He even bought some sprinklers to place randomly around the house to spray such water. Chris and I poured salt around every entrance and windowsill, a tiresome and busy job to say the least.

“Hey, I just wanted to check in on you, it’s been a rough couple of days.” I nod in agreement.

“Yea, I’m fine. It feels good to just be able to lay down though, despite the impending doom.”

“Yea,” he says, looking around my room as he seems to want to say more, “$name ... how do I ... I don’t ... what I mean to say is ...” He continues on, stuttering and tripping over every other word. I can imagine him thinking up his words, only for them to trip on his tongue and come stumbling out of his mouth, landing on the floor in a heap. He groans loudly and huffs in irritation.

“You’re blowing it, man!” Bradley shouts from his room, “it ain’t that hard.”

“Shut up and mind your business, Bradley.”

“Your screw up is loud enough for all of us to hear; therefore it is our business,” I hear Sydero shout from upstairs.

“Look, I just want to sleep so can this wait till morning?” I ask, taking a step back, prepared to close the door.

“No, no, no,” Chris states urgently, grabbing my hand and then blushing a minute later, “if I don’t say this now, then I’ll never say it.”

“Preach!” both Sydero and Bradley say in unison. Chris deadpans the door, closing his eyes before focusing on me once again.

“$name,” and I again see the words skip out of his mouth, skydiving and leaving him tongue-tied, “fuck! Why can’t I say these words! Why is it that every time I’m ready to say it, I get speechless and I can’t even remember what words are?” He shouts, pacing back and forth between the hallway and the entrance to my room. He points his finger at me, “this is your fault.”

“My fault?” I ask, completely confused now. I just wanted to go to sleep. My hair was probably a mess from squishing my face in the pillow, and I know I looked as tired as I felt.

“Yes, your fault. I can talk to any other girl, in fact, most girls would call me a flirt, me. The tongue-tied, I don’t know what I’m saying as I pace back and forth, guy.”

“Can’t see it,” Bradley shouts.

“What kind of Helen Keller women do you talk to?” Sydero screams from upstairs. Chris turns around and begins to mumble to the wall, causing me to doubt that I was really up. It would be just my luck that this was all a realistic dream, in a way it almost made me feel better.

“I’m just going to say it. $name, I like your face!” The entire house is silent, and it takes Chris a while to realize what he said, “I mean not just your face. I also like the stuff on it .... and what’s attached to it, and what’s in it? And ... just you ... I like you. A lot.” He sighs, and with a subtle brush, he scurries away from my door, leaving me standing there.

And this is precisely why they tell you not to date your teammates, co-workers, or anything like that.

I’m busy figuring it out when Chris appears again, but this time he doesn’t just stand there. With one look, he closes the distance between us and kisses me deeply. One of his arms snake around my waist as he guides me backward and into the wall. The other hand cups my cheek gently, holding me there in that moment. When we part, my gaze is blurry, my mind racing to catch up. And even when it catches up, it decides to lazily wander through the kiss, giggling as it relives every second of it.

“I’m sorry,” Chris chuckles lowly, “I really don’t know what I’m doing anymore.” He drops his gaze to the ground, blushing when he notices his stance and how close he is, as if he hadn’t just kissed me.

“I’m a mess,” he grumbles, shaking his head.

“But you can do that again,” I whisper into his ear. His head lifts as he looks me in the eye, his eyes softening as he finally realizes what I said. He cups my cheek and places a chaste kiss on my lips, and then another, and then another. Until finally he’s done playing, his lips capturing mine. I can feel the nervousness there, but I can also feel the excitement. The excitement of a first kiss shared with someone that you have longed months for.

“Took you forever,” I smirk, and he blushes in response.

“I would say better late than never, but this was killing me.” His finger traces my jawline, stopping at my chin, “you can’t imagine the sleepless nights I had, all because I was unable to tell you.”
“Hmm, I can imagine,” I say and give him one last kiss, “we should probably talk more about this tomorrow.”

“Yea, cos some of us tryna sleep!” Bradley shouts, and I hear a low grunt in the distance, probably belonging to Sydero. Chris nods and leans in for one more kiss. I can feel the restraint within him, trying to stop but not wishing to. When he finally moves, he whispers to me goodnight and heads back to his room. I close the door slowly, caring not about the smile that lights up my features.

His entire body screamed embarrassed and with nothing else said, he leaves my room with his tail tucked between his legs.

I close the door and go back to bed, thinking about the kiss and what me sending him away meant. They always said crushes go just as quickly as they come, especially when you’re finally faced with what you thought you always wanted. I close my eyes and let sleep overtake me for the night.

“Training, mostly. You guys need to know how to take out a demon. The good thing is, we have a demon you can practice on.” She points to herself, and I raise a brow.

“You don’t think this might be dangerous for you?”

She snorts, “holy water doesn’t hurt me, neither does salt, and you can’t exorcise me.”

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“How about iron or silver?” Chris questions, brandishing his knife.
	
	“Sure, but you gotta gut me like anyone else,” she says with a smirk, “now, hurry up and finish, sooner we get started the better.”

I finish my cereal and get dressed, grabbing my gun and blade before making my way outside. I sit on the porch, catching sight of one of the devil traps that Sydero had done. The devil trap is painted on the underside of the awning that shields the door and part of the porch from the sun, clever.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“Here, take these, they’ll keep you from getting possessed,” Bradley tells us, handing both Chris and me a unique appearing charm.
	
	“What about you?” Chris asks, and Bradley shakes his head.
	
	“I have an anti-possession tattoo, so I’m fine.”
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\

&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“Where?” I ask, never having seen a tattoo on him before. In his defense, I’ve never seen the kid without a shirt, so it’s likely that it’s somewhere either on his back or chest. I’m content with that thought until Bradley gives me a grin that matches that of the Cheshire cat.

“Do you really wanna know?” he asks, raising both brows with the question. I peer over at Sydero who shakes her head slowly, and I shake mine as well.

[[Continue-&gt;TS4_1]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1403" name="TS4_1" tags="" position="2503,5704" size="100,100">Bradley comes and sits beside me as Sydero stands in front of us like any proper instructor.

“First off, if we’re in for a fight, then this is not the same type of supernatural creatures you’re used to going up against. Everyone you guys been up against so far have been fighting off of instinct.”

&lt;&lt;if $combat &lt;= 30&gt;&gt;\
	I raise a hand, realize what I’m doing and then shake my head and put my hand down, “isn’t that a good thing? Instinct is how you should fight, right?”
	
	“No. Instinct isn’t bad, but it’s worse to go up against someone trained.”
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“Those werewolves in the forest, instinct. Those faeries, instinct. And that beast, definitely instinct. It should tell you something that we were able to beat them, but every time Raum and his little crew pops up, the only reason we get out of it is that we’re lucky. These guys are trained, they know how to fight, and even worse, they have abilities.”

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“This has got to be the direst lesson I’ve ever heard,” Chris whispers from beside me.
	
	“Good, keep listening,” Sydero tells him, tapping his forehead as she continues to pace back and forth in front of us.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“Well dang, Sydero, mind minimizing the whole doom and gloom part?”

	“No! This is serious,” Sydero tells me, pacing back and forth as she continues.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“Now, there are a few things that you can learn but doing too much won’t be wise. You won’t learn anything that way.” Syd points to Bradley who somehow found himself back on his laptop. I really shouldn’t be surprised. “Bradley can teach you how to exorcise a demon. While I can help teach you how to fight a demon who’s using their abilities to stop you. You also should practice either using your gun or blade and even on top of that, maybe learning more about demons so that you know more about them. Knowledge is just as powerful as training.”

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	I head over to Sydero with Chris and get her attention. She seems almost shocked that both of us wanted to practice with her, but she says nothing about it.

	“Alright, we’re going to do this with guns because if you get too close to a demon, then, well ...” she doesn’t finish her sentence, but I don’t think she has to, both of us got the picture.

	Chris and I back up, a couple of feet separating Sydero from us. “First things first, these demons are under Raum. They’re going to be lower-tier which means that, in a way, they’re just glorified shapeshifters.”

	“That’s a good thing, right?” I ask.

	Sydero lightly shrugs her shoulders, “depends on how you look at it. Like I said before, shapeshifters fight off instinct. Most of them like to punch the shit out of you and then run like hell. These demons are getting orders from Raum to probably kill. They won’t waste a second in trying to tear you apart.”

	“And the dire lessons continue,” Chris mumbles. I shriek as Chris’s body is suddenly thrown in the air, jumping away from him and then looking at a smirking Sydero. Her gaze moves to me.

	“Lesson starts now.”

	I dash out of the way before she can even think about throwing me up, pulling out my gun but then watching as it goes flying to the side. I leap after it, just as I feel my body go skidding across the ground, stopping right before I hit the porch.

	“Use your words, Sydero,” I shout.

	“I really don’t see how we’re supposed to win this,” Chris points out, crawling towards his gun but every time he almost gets there, his gun is moved just a bit more.

	“Firstly, lower-tier demons don’t have this ability, so me flinging you around is just for fun,” she tells us, shrugging her shoulders. We both give her an incredulous look, and she raises her hands in surrender, motioning for us to come at her.

	&lt;&lt;if $chris &gt;=50&gt;&gt;\
		I grab my blade as Chris uses his gun to try and get a good shot. As Chris lines up a shot, I get in close, not trying to cut her but trying to make her at least move. I notice that the only time she does move is when she dodges me. She sways from side to side, and I notice her eyes are only on my upper half, watching which way I’m about to attack.
		
		I smirk, finally. I continue to do what I’m doing and then once I see a good opening, I trip her. She goes down instantly but still manages to land on her feet. She stands up straighter, looking at me before laughing.
		
		“Well, damn. That was good. I’m impressed. Of course, I’m not dead, but normal demons aren’t on my level. Wow, did that sound conceited.” She shrugs and nods her head.
	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
		I grab my blade as Chris grabs his gun and then mine, darting to the other side and firing precisely towards Syd. With half her attention on him, and the other half on me, it’s quite easy to overpower her and get her to the ground. Once there, she sits and stares at the ground before suddenly beginning to laugh.
		
		“Well, damn. That was good. I’m impressed. Of course, I’m not dead, but normal demons aren’t on my level. Wow, did that sound conceited.” She shrugs, and I help her to her feet. That practice seems done.

I head over to Bradley, getting his attention.

“Syd said you can teach someone how to exorcise, can you really?” I ask, sitting beside him. I think he’s going to teach me from his seat, the last thing I predicted was for him to get up and stand in front of me like some college professor. He straightens his back and tries to deepen his voice.

“In fact, I do, my pupil. But exorcising is more than just saying some words. You have to know what level of demon you’re messing with, have to make sure you can’t be possessed next, know if you’re doing a reverse exorcism or the one everyone typically thinks when hearing the word exorcism.”

“Seriously, all that is needed to just get a demon out of a body?” I ask, and Bradley leans in, uncomfortably close.

“Tell me, how do you exorcise a wraith?”

[[“With dedication?”]]
[[“What’s a wraith?”]]
[[“Silver. Or iron ...”]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1406" name="pb" tags="" position="2524,5814" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;set $blades +=5&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
I go into the clearing that has some do it yourself targets set up. They range from short to long distance. The targets were mostly for shooting, but one could also practice throwing their blade as well. I do that at first, warming up my arms before doing some practice throws. Once I’m ready, I throw the knife at the intended targets, hoping to get a bullseye.

At first, my goal seems unattainable. Each time I throw the blade it either lands in the grass with a soft plop, or it hits the outer rings of the target, falling out soon after. The more I throw it though, the closer I get until I keep hitting the bullseye. After becoming familiar with how to throw, I begin to add movement, adding quick stops and turning quickly right before throwing it. Again, I’m left disappointed. But still, the more I practice, the better I get.

I stop when my arm begins to get sore, telling myself that it would be smarter to just take a break since only so much can be accomplished in a day.

&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
I head to the clearing with the targets and prep them for some target practice. I put them in a variety of places. This way I would be able to run and search and immediately aim, working on multiple things. I check my gun and the ammo, making sure the ammo is only rock salt. I do some practice shots, hitting almost every shot that I take, though some don’t hit at all. After feeling like I was adequately warmed up, I begin the actual exercise I had planned for myself.

The first three targets are easy to hit, they were lined up right alongside one another, and I only needed to hit each one consecutively, as fast as I can. After that, two are higher up on trees, and I shoot them, though my aim is off on the second shot. I continue.

The third and fourth require me to climb a tree and balance myself to hit both. I do this and then jump down, as I go down, I tag the fifth. The last three are hidden in bushes, and after feeling like I was in some cliché action movie, I find them and shoot them quickly. Two of the bullets don’t hit, and so I redo the move over, this time getting them.

Surprisingly, I was sweating, and I decide to end that training for the day, I would need these bullets, best not to waste them.

I go inside and grab the book, cranking it open and looking through the table of contents for the demon section. What I find is a heading and underneath that, sub-headings with specific types of demons. I decided to just go for the general idea of a demon.

Demons are malevolent spirits that originate from Hell. There are various types of demons, making it hard to truly speak for all of them. All demons are immortal beings and even the lower level demons have impressive power. Your typical demon cannot be born, only created by extensively torturing a once pure soul and sending them to Hell. There, the souls become corrupted and come back as demons with no past knowledge of who they were before. The majority of demons who walk on Earth must possess a body in order to do so, meaning that they can be exorcised.

The lowest level of demons, mostly known as either “low-tier demons” or “lesser demons” make up the majority of the demon population. These demons are the weakest and have the basic powers that all demons possess including enhanced senses, invulnerability, and immortality. These demons have mild forms that only include a change in eye color to black, and they possess no skin, symbolizing their time in hell.

I continue reading, going deeper and deeper and learning about mid-tier and higher-tier demons. When I’m done, I close the book and put it back where I found it.

“Commitment and perseverance? This ain’t no motivational speech, this is life!” Bradley shouts, and with one hand I move him back a few more steps, at least until he’s again at the railing.

“But honestly, yes, all of this is important. Let’s say you didn’t have an anti-possessing charm or something like that, then the demon might just jump to you. Demons are crafty bastards, just imagine an army of them that act like Sydero but even more uncaring.” That was a horrible thing to picture. “I’ve heard of some demons acting like the exorcism worked, only at the last minute to either possess the person or kill them.”

“I understand, so what then?” Bradley types something into his computer and turns it towards me.

“Now, you probably won’t memorize this in time for whatever is going to happen, but you can start. That, and you can probably scare some of the demons with it. Just saying the first three words will have some demons running for cover. But not all.”

The two of us begin, Bradley helping me to understand how to pronounce the words and what they mean. When I don’t question him, he lectures about what demons can be exorcised easily, and which ones will have to be trapped or just can’t be at all. He talks about how not all creatures from hell can be exorcised and how wraiths are one of those creatures.

By the time we’re done, I feel like I have at least the first quarter memorized enough, though that would have to be tested against me fearing for my life.

“Exactly. You don’t even know what it is. You could be muttering a bunch of powerful words that won’t even have an effect on the creature you’re trying to get. Or even better, you might try to exorcise something you think is a demon, but isn’t.”

“I would laugh if this weren’t a serious question,” Bradley tells me, staring at me with not even so much as a mouth corner curl. He continues to stare at me until he suddenly laughs, grabbing his stomach as he tries to calm down. “Okay, but that was actually a good one. May I throw in the running, silron?” I chuckle.

“But honestly, yes, all of this is important. Let’s say you didn’t have an anti-possessing charm or something like that, then the demon might just jump to you. Demons are crafty bastards, just imagine an army of them that act like Sydero but even more uncaring.” That was a horrible thing to picture. “I’ve heard of some demons acting like the exorcism worked, only at the last minute to either possess the person or kill them.”

“I understand, so what then?” Bradley types something into his computer and turns it towards me.

“Now, you probably won’t memorize this in time for whatever is going to happen, but you can start. That, and you can probably scare some of the demons with it. Just saying the first three words will have some demons running for cover. But not all.”

The two of us begin, Bradley helping me to understand how to pronounce the words and what they mean. When I don’t question him, he lectures about what demons can be exorcised easily, and which ones will have to be trapped or just can’t be at all. He talks about how not all creatures from hell can be exorcised and how wraiths are one of those creatures.

By the time we’re done, I feel like I have at least the first quarter memorized enough, though that would have to be tested against me fearing for my life.

&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
After a few hours, Bradley decides to call a break. Mostly for him, but a break nevertheless. I keep most of my thoughts to myself though when I see Bradley bring out a plate stacked with sandwiches.

“Sorry that they’re not that diverse, we only have so many ingredients.”

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“A sandwich, my dear Bradley, is a sandwich,” Chris says, taking one and then thanking him. I go over next and grab a sandwich, taking a seat on the porch where I had last put my water bottle.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“Thanks anyway, I was hoping for some kind of snack,” I tell Bradley with a smile and then take one. I grab a seat on the porch, right next to my half-empty water bottle.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

As we eat, Sydero continues to practice, doing an assortment of things from teleporting to actually using her telekinesis powers. The last thing she does is create a ball of dark energy, black mist surrounding her as she does it. But as soon as she starts, she stops, dropping to one knee.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“Out of juice?” Chris questions, reaching for another sandwich.
	
	“No, she’s just trying to stay relatively balanced,” Bradley answers, “it ... it feels good to be able to talk about this with you guys now. I know you’re not completely happy about not being told sooner but ...” Bradley shrugs and takes another bite of his sandwich, sitting comfortably as he finishes whatever he was going to say in his head.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“What’s her problem? Tired?” I ask, finishing up the sandwich in my hands.
	
	“No, she’s just trying to stay relatively balanced,” Bradley answers, “it ... it feels good to be able to talk about this with you now. I know you’re not completely happy about not being told sooner but ...” Bradley shrugs and takes another bite of his sandwich, sitting comfortably as he finishes whatever he was going to say in his head.

&lt;&lt;if $uncledead is false&gt;&gt;\
	As I eat, I feel something vibrating in my pocket, reaching in and seeing that the caller was my uncle.
	
	“Hello?” I ask and immediately move the phone away from my ear, still being able to hear him scream at me loud and clear. Bradley raises a brow but doesn’t ask any questions, continuing to eat.
	
	“Just stop screaming at me,” I tell him, sighing.
	
	“I thought you were dead!” he screams again, “I turn on the tv and boom, there goes your face, yet again, on the news. Only this time it’s because you’re no longer a threat. I’ve had so many Carol’s and Beatrice’s call me to say that they’re sorry, but you were a bad apple anyway.”
	
	“Yea, well, Syd just decided to start that fire and make me seem dead. Sorry about not calling you. I was planning to do it.”
	
	&lt;&lt;if $uncleknows&gt;&gt;\
		“Is it the folks that are after you?” he asks me, and I confirm his thoughts. Since he already knew about the supernatural and everything that had happened, I catch him up as best as I can. I’m sure I leave some parts out, but it matters little. By the time I’m done, my uncle sounds ready to hit up the bar, and I can’t blame him.
		
		Before hanging up, I let him know that I’ll probably be ghost again, seeing that we were about to go after Raum. I hang up later, ready to start practicing again.
	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
		“Is it the mafia? You never really told me,” he points out, and I’m happy he did, knowing me I would’ve blabbed about everything that had happened, forgetting that he didn’t know. I catch him up as best as I can, going slow to think through some things and then leaving some parts out.
		
		Before hanging up, I let him know that I’ll probably be ghost again, just to make sure that I was truly in the clear. I hang up later, ready to start practicing again.
	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

After we all finish eating, we go back to practice.

I help Sydero up to her feet and turn my attention to the Lieutenant.

“She’s dying today, this is how you treat a prisoner who will no longer see another sunrise?”

“She is not a prisoner, she is a monster,” the Lieutenant scowls but does nothing else. Instead, he shouts orders to the guards at his side before stalking off.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“That man is a menace,” Sydero says, looking the two of us up and down, “did something happen?” While Chris keeps watch, I tell Sydero about what the deity told me, and then tell her about the spell. We stand in silence as Sydero goes over the spell a couple of times to herself, marking things off and whispering to herself every now and then.

	“Yea, I can do it. But the witch has to die first.”

	“Could we just drop a house on her?” Chris mumbles, both of us ignoring him.

	“We’re hoping she’ll come to see your execution.”

	“How do you know what she’ll look like?”

	&lt;&lt;if $truth&gt;&gt;\
		“Esther, one of the servants. I told her about us, so she knows what’s going on. She said she’ll help.” Sydero nods, about to say more, when the guards come over, iron chains in their hands.

		“Esther, one of the servants. I coerced her into helping me.” Sydero nods, about to say more, when the guards come over, iron chains in their hands.
	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
	
	We move out of their way, watching as they set the chains over Sydero’s wrist and then lead her away.

	“See you at the execution,” she shouts over her shoulder, a giddiness in her voice.

	Chris and I follow behind them, joining the crowd once we get to the execution circle. I search for Esther while Chris searches for anyone who might look even the bit suspicious.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	I do nothing, not even looking in Sydero’s direction as I get to the Lieutenant’s side.

	“Hunter, good morning. Great day for an execution, isn’t it?” he questions joyfully, and I nod, throwing a look over at Sydero who wipes some blood from her mouth and rolls her eyes.

	I wait until the guards and Lieutenant walk off before putting my full attention on Sydero.

	“That man is a menace,” Sydero says, looking at me up and down, “did something happen?” I tell Sydero about what the deity told me, and then tell her about the spell.

“Anything yet?” I question. Looking around but again, not knowing what I was looking for.

“No, but I believe she’ll be at the back of the group. In case something goes astray.”

“Then let’s start there.” As we search, a low drum begins to play, playing a heavy, mournful song. I half expect dark clouds to move in and rain to start falling along with the beat of the drum. But the sun stays planted, and only a few clouds dot the light blue sky overhead. It would seem that even the weather cared little for the supposed execution.

I watch as they march Sydero’s figure onto the stage, everyone booing as they throw items at her. The crowd cheers for her impending death, some even stating that they should do it slowly, to cause her to suffer. These people didn’t even know her, didn’t know her crimes, only knew what she looked like, and that was enough to condemn her. I turn up my nose as I continue searching for our witch.

“$name,” Esther shrieks softly, yanking me and pointing to a figure that stood near the back of the crowd. The character wore a black hood that did an excellent job of hiding most of their features.

“How do you know for sure?”

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“That is the same cloak that the witch wore when I first saw her.” I nod my thanks to Esther, gazing around for Chris. I see him closer to the stage. He wouldn’t get here fast enough, that and his help probably would be as helpful as it always was.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“That is the same cloak that the witch wore when I first saw her.” I nod my thanks to Esther, gazing back at the witch.

I could tell her that the King would like to thank her, sending me to fetch her, though I don’t exactly look like a servant or guard. There really wasn’t any other lie to be told. 

“Stop,” I hear the Entity hiss.

“Oh, so now you want to surface. Mind answering some questions?” I hiss right back. This wasn’t the time; I didn’t have time to focus on them and the witch.

“That can be done at a later time. This witch is not what she seems. Stop.”

“Shut up,” I bark back. I was almost there, so why did I feel something creeping over me, as if trying to tell me that the Entity spoke the truth. Before I could take another step, the witch moves her eyes to me, and a thick black mist shoots from her body and into me. I yell in pain as I’m thrown back, skidding across the ground and into Esther’s waiting arms.

“$name!” she shouts, my hearing, along with my vision, going in and out as I try to get my bearings back.

“You!” I hear an unfamiliar voice shout, along with some screaming and the sound of feet pounding against a hardpacked ground.

“You must get up now,” Esther shouts at me.

“Esther, get out of here,” I tell her weakly, pushing myself up just as a force hits me again. I skid across the ground, wishing for a single minute to get my bearings.

“You won’t survive this,” the Entity scolds me, “but, you can.”

I raise a brow at their words, my brain asking how. “Give me control. I can get you out of this mess.”

“Yea, right. Like I’m going to allow that,” I snicker. Pushing myself up to my feet, looking in the distance that I last saw the witch. Before the Entity could plead their case further, I feel something grab my neck, and I turn my gaze to see the witch standing there, her eyes burning with anger and hurt.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“You took my family from me!” With incredible strength, she slams my body into the ground, her grip on my neck never faltering. “So I’ll take your life.” 

	My vision begins to swim again. On the edge of my consciousness, I can hear Chris calling my name. I can hear the screams of those nearby, and the officials trying to calm everyone down as they try and figure out what was going on. And then I catch them, their words echoing in my head.

	“You’ll die unless you let me help.” I clench my eyes closed, tasting my own death on my tongue.

	Chris and I meet Esther in the stables. Already saddled up are three horses, each pacing with anticipation.

	“Are you ready?” Esther questions us, mounting her horse and looking towards us both. We weren’t, it was too early in the morning, in all honesty, but what could one do? We nod and mount up, following her away from the castle, away from the main square where I notice the execution is to take place. And then towards the countryside.

	“You think she’ll be way out here?” I ask, leaning forward in my horse as I catch up with Esther.

	“She appears as a witch and claims she is one. Whether Cimmerian in appearance or human, no innkeeper will allow her to stay in their buildings. And no one will welcome her into their home.”

	“So that automatically means she’ll be out here?” Chris asks, not trying to hide his unhappiness.

	“It is the only place she could exist in peace.” We stop asking questions, focusing on the task of finding her. We peer into different huts and buildings along the way, knocking on doors to ask if they had seen her. We try bars and other places that could be used for shelter but were also inconspicuous enough to be overlooked by others. Each area feels like a failure, and as the sun rises higher in the sky, our time begins to lessen.

	“Maybe we should head back, see if we can spot her amongst the people coming for the execution.”

	“If we spot her, then she can spot us,” I point out, but Chris doesn’t seem to care much about that. He’s already turning his horse around and making his way back towards town, ignoring me. Which, in a way, is quite funny, since we both know he’ll be the first to be disposed of in a fight. Esther follows behind him, and I do so as well, rolling my eyes and grumbling to myself as we ride.

	I continue to look for her as we go, searching some of the faces that head towards the center of the square. My eyes land on a figure with a conspicuous cloak. I look over at Esther, and she looks back at me, nodding. Got her. I give the reins to Esther and head towards the woman.

	“Stop,” I hear the Entity suddenly hiss.

	“You!” I hear an unfamiliar voice shout, along with some screaming and the sound of feet pounding against a hardpacked ground.
	
	“You must get up now,” Esther shouts at me.
	
	“Esther, get out of here,” I tell her weakly, pushing myself up just as a force hits me again. I skid across the ground, wishing for a single minute to get my bearings.
	
	“You won’t survive this,” the Entity scolds me, “but, you can.” I raise a brow at their words, my brain asking how. “Give me control. I can get you out of this mess.”
	
	“Yea, right. Like I’m going to allow that,” I snicker. Pushing myself up to my feet, looking in the distance that I last saw the witch. Before the Entity could plead their case further, I feel something grab my neck, and I turn my gaze to see the witch standing there, her eyes burning with anger and hurt.
	
	“You took my family from me!” With incredible strength, she slams my body into the ground, her grip on my neck never faltering. “So I’ll take your life.” My vision begins to swim again. On the edge of my consciousness I can hear the screams of those nearby, and the officials trying to calm everyone down as they try and figure out what was going on. And then I hear them, their words echoing in my head.

	“You’ll die, unless you let me help.” I clench my eyes closed, tasting my own death on my tongue.

[[No.-&gt;EP8-Act Four]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1419" name="FC4" tags="" position="5175,4400" size="100,100">Before I can think further about this power, I hear an ear-piercing scream. The woman’s body is slung over our heads and into the wall behind us, freeing Bradley whose legs give out almost immediately.

“Pathetic,” the Entity growls as they approach her. She raises her hand, but before she can summon any power, it freezes in the air, and her body begins to convulse. She lets out a high-pitched scream as the black mist begins to seep from her body at to the floor. Her screams rise, and I start to worry about others hearing it, unlike the Entity who seems to bask in the sound. With the last of the black mist gone, her screams fade, and she falls to the ground.

Before I can question them, the Entity walks towards the body and picks up the blade that the woman had still been gripping tightly too. With no mercy, no second thought, he plunges the knife into her head with unforeseen strength.

The feeling that overtakes me now is different, a euphoric one that could be compared to someone relaxing on the beach with their favorite drink, and the weather just right. The feeling fades after not too long, and I find myself in control of my body again. The Entity’s laughter fades from my mind.

“$name, is it you?” I hear Bradley question, slowly approaching me.

I nod my head and turn to him, “how’s your neck?”

“Don’t change the topic of conversation. What the hell was that? You went Super Saiyan!”

“That was the thing living inside of me,” I tell him, and he blushes deeply, probably embarrassed at not believing me. He takes a seat beside me and sighs heavily, scratching the side of his head, not sure what to say next, and so, I speak.

“What have you been doing this whole time?”

“I only woke up because that crazy woman barged in here. When no one was waking up, I knew something was off, but I haven’t even begun to figure it out because I was fighting her.” Now that I look around, no longer focused on the dead woman not too far off, the motel room is a complete mess. The television is broken, tables flipped over, it seemed like the only thing spared were the beds.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	Bradley nods to the still slumbering people in bed, “what about them?”

	“Sydero knows how to get out.”

	“You don’t think your disappearance is going to cause them to pause?” He raised a good point.

	&lt;&lt;if $sydero &gt;=50&gt;&gt;\
		“Hopefully, it doesn’t. I’m hoping Sydero just goes on and does the spell.”
	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\

	It takes only a few more hours before Sydero and Chris both shoot up from their sleep as if waking from some nightmare.

	“That’s it,” Chris begins after making sure he was back, “I’m never going to sleep again.”

	“Join my legion of the undead,” Bradley jokes. Sydero gazes over at me, raising a brow, but then looks past me, at the dead body that still lies on the floor.

	“Care to explain that?” she questions, looking from Bradley to me.

I stay by my car for a while, getting my head in order and hoping that the Entity would explain themselves. I try to go as far into my own mind as humanly possible, but the action itself feels alien. As if trying to root out a problem that I was in full denial against.

“Entity!” I scream silently.

“Shh, pet,” he whispers sleepily. His shadow figure slowly appearing. He’s lying on a flat surface made up of the fog that I have come to associate with him.

“Who are you?”

&lt;&lt;if $Cimmerian&gt;&gt;\
	“Hmm, some measly witches tell you I’m not who I seem, and you just take it and run with it, huh?”
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“Hmm, some measly deity from another world tells you I’m not who I seem, and you just take it and run with it, huh?”
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“Are you claiming that you’re not different from the creature that I had with me as a child? Because if so then fine, then you’re still the weak figure of my childhood.” I add the last part in only because I have learned by now that if anything is going to get a rise out of him, it’s that. And like I guessed, it does.

His eyes shine a bright golden, and before I know it, he’s standing over me, “you’re right, I’m not that weak creature that you knew so well.” He leans in with a dangerous smirk, “I’m five times worse.”

Suddenly, I’m back inside my car, staring out the window at the miserable motel.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	I get out, [[spotting Chris]] sitting on the brick pathway that leads to a small dull flower patch. [[Sydero is off to the side]], looking over a vending machine. And I surmise that [[Bradley is inside]], doing whatever Bradley’s do.

I hear her cry out in pain and her grip on me loosens, allowing me some much-needed air.

&lt;&lt;if $Cimmerian&gt;&gt;\
	“I got you!” I hear Asher shout out, and her grip totally disappears. I take in gulps of air, each one more refreshing than the last. I really needed to stop taking air for granted.

	I turn to see where Asher and the witch was, the two wrestling to the side of me. I glance around for Sydero and find her further off, her eyes closed. Suddenly, a wave of darkness surged from Sydero and towards the two, knocking into both and sending them flying. Asher doesn’t seem harmed, and I lose track of him as he turns into a shadow as soon as the wave hits. The witch, on the other hand, lands against the ground and goes rolling, gasping in pain.

	It was time to end this before she could get her second wind. I grab my blade and rush to her side, letting the darkness of the land rush over me and help me forward. I get to her and dodge her flying fists, gripping the blade harder before plunging it into her chest. Her eyes widen as the colors in them lighten up, the black draining out of them, trickling down her cheeks and to the ground beneath us. The last of the black gives way to tears as she stares at me.

	“I just want my family,” I hear her whisper before she falls into my arms, dead. I stay in my spot, glaring down at the body as her words repeat in my head.

	“Even the monsters have a story, huh?” Asher questions, helping me up as he stares down at the body, I guess he heard what she said.

	“Yea, I say,” trailing off. Adrenaline had left my body, leaving me tired, ready to just fall to the ground. In fact, that was probably what I should do.

	The witch is momentarily staring at her before looking back at me, but it’s that pause that allows me to act. I shoot towards her, blade in hand, and attempt to stab her again. At the last minute, she focuses back on me. 
	
The blade grazes her side, if she hadn’t focused back in, then she would be dead now.

	The two of us fight, her doing more dodging and whimpering in pain at her new wound, as I try to stab her for good.

All those movies that made it seem like you had to be one with your weapon to truly wield it, I always believed them to be rubbish, but that was the feeling I had. The blade was an extension of my arm, it was as much as my hand as my actual hand was. Every attack had a purpose, every dodge was countered with a lunge of my own that kept her on her toes. I didn’t give her any room to mess up.
		
		And that was her downfall.
	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\

It left me tired, in need of a bed, though the ground would do all the same. In fact, that was probably what I should do.

“What’s that?” I ask Bradley who just happens to be standing beside me. He gazes up from his laptop, not knowing what I’m talking about until he actually sees it for himself. He moves his computer from his lap and stares at the darkening sky. Suddenly, the mist dives down, disappearing from the sky and leaving the two of us confused.

“Inside, now!” Sydero shouts, grabbing weapons with haste.

“Wait, what? What was that? Do you know?” I question when she approaches.

“Demons, a lot of them. Let’s go now!” With an urgent push, she herds us back into the house, running around grabbing things and trying to find weapons.

	“Hey, Syd,” Bradley tries, but she continues to rush around, naturally in her own little world. Bradley tries again, still to no avail. He finally grabs her by her shoulders, getting her attention before asking what the rest of us can do.
	&lt;&lt;if $nerve &lt; 30&gt;&gt;\
		My fingers shake as I check everything, trying to calm down and finding it impossible. I slam the gun in my hands down on the table, running my hands unsteadily over my face as I take in multiple deep breaths. 
		
		“You okay?” Bradley asks, inching a step closer to me.

		“Just, you never know how nervous you are until it comes down to it.”
		
		“Just remember that these suckers hate holy water and it gives you plenty of time to run after sloshing them with it.” I nod, though his words do little to calm my trembling hands.
	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
		I take in a deep breath as I place the ammo in my gun, doing so with practiced ease. I check it and put it on safety before grabbing some holy water and checking my blade.

		“You seem to be taking this well,” Bradley says, sliding up beside me as he places his laptop in his bag, then grab some holy water.

		“I know I haven’t really gone up against demons, but after fighting werewolves and cryptids, this doesn’t seem all that different. Especially since we have a cambion on our side.”

		“Special mutt,” Sydero chimes in, walking by the door.

		“Yea, that,” I say with a smile and a shrug, going back to preparing.
	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
	
	The house wasn’t prepared, but we were, and that was the best that we could hope for at the moment. For crying out loud, we were going up against demons, there was only so much we could actually do. I take a seat by the windows, glancing outside, waiting for any sign of people coming.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

About thirty minutes later is when I see a mass of figures appearing. They don’t bother to hide, stepping into the open as they approach at their own pace. At the head, I can make out the familiar faces of Langston and Petri, but all those surrounding them are faces I have never seen.

“Is that the grocer from the store?” Bradley questions, appearing at my side.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“They probably possessed half the town,” Sydero informs as she enters with Chris at her side.
	
	“And what happens when we’re done here? They just leave the citizens to wonder where their night went?” Chris ponders, and Sydero raises an eyebrow as she spares him a glance.
	
	“Bold of you to assume that they’ll actually survive this ordeal. Most demons end up killing their host before moving on.”
	
	“Hold up,” Chris interjects, seeming to forget the demon army that’s just hanging outside the house, “you’re telling me demons will just possess an entire town, kill them all, and then call it a day?”
	
	“They’re demons, not saints. What do you think happened in Roanoke?” This actually causes all of us to stop and look at Sydero, obviously wanting to hear more.
	
	“Look sharp,” she commands, nodding to the window just as Petri begins to shout.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“They probably possessed half the town,” Sydero informs, being the last of us to enter.
	
	“And we get to fight them all, great. So what do we do with the bodies just laying around here tomorrow?” I question, looking over at a chuckling Bradley.
	
	“That’s cute,” he starts, nudging me as I had just told a joke, “you think we’re gonna survive long enough to see tomorrow.” He does a pig-like snort, only stopping when we hear Petri start to shout something.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“How about we just skip the bloodshed part of tonight and skip right to you surrendering,” he begins.

[[Stay silent.-&gt;TS_Silent]]

“So be it,” Petri sings. I peak out the window and see the demon militia approaching, at their own pace, but they would be at the door any minute.

&lt;&lt;if $scry&gt;&gt;\
	“I really hope all that stuff was worth it,” I tell Sydero after ducking back down, and she grins, looking over at Bradley. I look to see him on his phone, some minutes later glancing up and smiling widely.
	
	“I need you to say it, Syd.”
	
	“I’m not saying it,” she growls in response.
	
	Bradley moans childishly, “come on, when do I ever ask you for things like this?”
	
	“All the time!”
	
	“Please, Syd?!”
	
	&lt;&lt;if $serious &gt;= 50&gt;&gt;\
		“Um guys, demon army outside, getting closer by the second,” I remind.
	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
		“Yea, Syd, please,” I beg along with him, though I have no clue what I’m asking for.
	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
	
	Sydero growls and utters something inaudible before sighing, “make it rain, Bradley!”
	
	“Hell yea!” I see him hit something and peer out of the window to see the sprinklers cut on, each demon shouting in pain, “holy water, bitches!” I watch as the majority of them try and fight to pass the sprinklers that surround the house, but they fail. Though the damage couldn’t be seen due to the human skins they wear, a large amount of smoke rising towards the sky is an indicator.
	
	But of course, having a werewolf and shapeshifter on your side gives you benefits. The two make quick work of the sprinklers, destroying them and then commanding for the still recovering demons to charge the house. They do just that, but the salt keeps them out. I can hear Langston and Petri shout at them for their incompetence. Just when I think we’re actually doing something, I see a figure approaching and next thing I know, the window is breaking as the figure busts in, interrupting the salt line and starting the battle.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“Well, I guess this is it,” I tell Sydero after ducking back down, and she nods her head solemnly.
	
	“There was nothing we could do but prepare ourselves, we’re going to have to make it work.” We all get away from the window and behind the furniture that we had overturned to act more like barriers. Sydero had drawn some devil traps on the ceiling over the doors, and some windows before the marker died. Hopefully that would do something; otherwise, it was a clean shot straight to us.
	
	I check my gun once again, right as something comes hurtling through the window, and the door of the house is busted down, starting the battle.

“Roe. Do you really think you’re ready for this? How about a deal? You give us Sydero, and we give you a week to run off. You can get yourself cleansed and go off the grid. By then, that poison inside of you should’ve worn off.”

[[Continue-&gt;TS5_1]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1432" name="TS5_1" tags="" position="2859,5701" size="100,100">I leap away from Petri and some of the demons that are the first to charge in. Acutely aware of the nearby sound of the door being busted down by who I’m guessing is Langston. The two of them are free to walk around, but the demons that come pouring into the area immediately find themselves stuck by the devil traps.

“Nice touch,” I tell Sydero who sends me a cocky smirk.

“Keep Langston and Petri busy for a second, I can only handle so much while doing this.” I do as she says, shooting at Petri and then at Langston, almost hitting both as their attention was on why the demons were hindered. With their anger focused on me, Sydero’s eyes turn demonic, and she faces the stuck demons.

At the last minute, I leap over a couch, acting as if I was going to reshoot them. They approach but stop when they hear the demons yell in unison. We all look to see dark smoke seeping out of the bodies and towards the floor, each human throwing up what seems to be black ash as a wailing sound fills the room. And then it’s over, the smoke disappears, and the bodies fall to the ground in what I hope is a state of unconsciousness.

“Damn, your army falls quick,” I joke, and instead of turning their ire to me, they surge towards the devil traps, disrupting them and allowing the demons not affected, to come in.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“You can do that again? Right?” Chris asks Syd, backing into the wall as the demons surge towards us. Sydero flings a few of the quicker ones back, clenching her teeth as she fights for her eyes to stay amber. 

	“Yea, but it’s going to be a while, that and I need to focus long enough to actually summon the energy and the power.”

	“In other words, that ability is in cooldown,” Bradley shouts shrieking as he rushes up the stairs and away from a demon who almost grabs him.

I grab the demon and with all my strength, throw him away from Bradley. In a rage, the demon turns to me and charges.

[[Trip him up.]]
[[Throw holy water on him.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1433" name="Wait for him." tags="" position="2874,5910" size="100,100">I prepare myself, getting into a stance that was ready to intercept him. I bide my time, albeit nervously, but I stay put regardless. He gets closer, and at the last minute, I dive out of the way, allowing him to run right into the wall.

&lt;&lt;if $style is &quot;Aikido&quot;&gt;&gt;\
	He turns around, but I’m ready for him, grabbing his forearm and then jamming my elbow towards his chin, pushing him back until he falls over. His fall doesn’t last long, and he lunges, straight at me, but he doesn’t realize the gap. I swoop under the arm he doesn’t use and then grab his shoulder, slinging him to the ground.

	This time, I put more distance between the two of us, backing up as he pounds the ground in anger and then comes at me. He feints to the side, successfully gaining the upper hand as he punches my side and then trips me. I grab onto his shirt and yank as hard as I can, readjusting myself until I can catch his wrist, and then flip him easily.

	“Are you just going to keep flipping me?” he asks, darting towards me. I flip him again, but this time he grabs me, and I go down with him. I stomp my foot into his stomach as I try to separate myself from him.
&lt;&lt;elseif $style is &quot;Judo&quot;&gt;&gt;\
	I let him turn around, preparing myself as he gets closer. He collides into me just as I planned and with a steady breath, I prepare myself. As soon as I can get my arms around his midsection, I hook my foot and trip him, leaning my weight so that I would end up falling on him.

	I quickly get back to my feet, finding him to be faster than me in that aspect. He throws his first punch, and then his second. I back away, continuing to dodge him as I go. Biding my time and searching for an opening. One presents itself, and as soon as he attempts to punch me again, I block the punch with my arm and move in. With the other arm, I sling it around his neck and back into him, tossing him to the ground.

	“I’ll rip you apart,” he screams, kicking my knee. I grit my teeth in pain, not being fast enough to avoid the punch that he lands to my cheek. I stumble backward, pushing away the pain. He lunges forward and grabs the side of my shoulder. I instantly put up my defenses before again putting my arm around him. I instinctively sweep his feet out, and with my arm still grasping his neck, I deliver punch after punch.
	
	It is only after about six of them that I decide to put space in between us, gathering myself as he groans on the ground from the assault.
&lt;&lt;elseif $style is &quot;Boxing&quot;&gt;&gt;\
	He turns and charges towards me and with swift feet, I duck out of the way, giving him an extra push towards the wall. He groans as he collides but doesn’t let it slow him down, turning towards me and throwing his first punch. I keep my defenses up, paying attention to how he fights and any apparent weaknesses. 

	Sydero had been truthful when she said that these enemies were trained. This demon, in particular, kept a decent stance and threw punches as if this wasn’t his first time. I don’t get far, trying to find an opening and failing. Instead, I just keep backing up and trying to block any punch that he sends my way, highly annoyed by my lack of offense.

	Finally, I see an opening. It’s a small one, and if it weren’t for my instincts, then I would have missed it entirely. I swing towards his ribcage, and he doubles over in pain. I take the time to deliver a swift yet classic haymaker, watching as he falls to the ground.
&lt;&lt;elseif $style is &quot;Taekwondo&quot;&gt;&gt;\
	He jerks around, and as soon as he does, I send a kick to the side of his face. He immediately falls to the ground, groaning from the pain before his groan turns into a growl. He comes towards me and right as I’m about to kick him, he catches my foot, landing a punch to my stomach and then cheek. With my leg still in his hand, he pushes me away, and I hit the floor harshly.

	He huffs happily before coming forward. I lightly jump back and forth on my toes, waiting for an opening to present itself. The first kick I deliver is to his knee. And, like I imagined, he drops by instinct and as soon as he does, I swing the other across his face. 
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	He charges towards me and I prepare, blocking most of the punches that he throws at me. Before I can move back, he grabs my shirt and flings me into the nearby wall. I’m unable to move as he keeps me pinned, posed for another punch. Combining what Sydero had showed me and instinct, I quickly deflect the hit and then strike at his chin and kick the knee furthest from me. His attention is off of me and his grip loosened, I push him away and get some much-needed space.

	“Fancy. Won’t help you much though,” he tells me angrily. I growl and decide to go on the offensive. With my palm, I strike him in the throat and then turn and deliver a back kick to whatever my foot hits first. I hear a grunt and a thud. It was time to end this.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

&lt;&lt;if $exorcism is 20&gt;&gt;\
	I steady myself and turn to the demon, doing my best to recall the exact words for the exorcism. I begin, finding a small bit of comfort in the shock that spreads across the demon’s face. His eyes widen, and he twitches slowly, a short trail of dark grey smoke seeping off of his body.
	
	I can already tell that I won’t be able to end this exorcism, forgetting the other half of it. I remember Bradley’s words about not attempting this if I’m not confident in the entire thing, as it will only piss the demon off more. I stop but as soon as I do, another voice chimes in to finish it. I look to see Bradley at my side as he ends exorcising the demon.
	
	“Seriously?” he questions, and I shrug nervously.
	
	“I almost had it,” I say, and he just rolls his eyes and goes back to the fight.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	I steady myself and turn to the demon. He rolls his neck around and then leaps towards me.
	
	“Syd, let me borrow that blade of yours,” I shout, but instead of giving it to me, she moves into my view, throwing one of her blades at the demon’s forehead. The demon looks to have a seizure before falling to the ground, dead. “Oh, because letting me hold it was just out of the question, huh?”
	
	“If anyone but me touch these blades, then they just turn into normal knives, so yea,” she tells me and then immediately goes back to join the fight. Well, now the question was where could I get a blade or two like those.

	Sydero had been truthful when she said that these enemies were trained. This demon, in particular, kept a decent stance and threw punches as if this wasn’t his first time. I don’t get far, trying to find an opening and failing. Instead, I just keep backing up and trying to block any punch that he sends my way, highly annoyed by my lack of offense.

	Finally, I see an opening. It’s a small one, and if it weren’t for my instincts, then I would have missed it entirely. I swing towards his ribcage, and he doubles over in pain. I take the time to deliver a swift yet classic haymaker, watching as he falls to the ground.
&lt;&lt;elseif $style is &quot;Taekwondo&quot;&gt;&gt;\
	He gets up and jerks around, and as soon as he does, I send a kick to the side of his face. He immediately falls to the ground, groaning from the pain before his groan turns into a growl. He comes towards me and right as I’m about to kick him, he catches my foot, landing a punch to my stomach and then cheek. With my leg still in his hand, he pushes me away, and I hit the floor harshly.

	He huffs happily. And though trained, he is obviously unwise to let his guard down, even if he thinks he has the upper-hand. He comes forward, and as I lightly jump back and forth on my toes, I wait for an opening to present itself. The first kick I deliver to his knee. Like I imagined, he drops by instinct and as soon as he does, I swing the other across his face.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	He charges towards me and I prepare, blocking most of the punches that he throws at me. Before I can move back, he grabs my shirt and flings me into the nearby wall. I’m unable to move as he keeps me pinned, posed for another punch. Combining what Sydero had showed me and instinct, I quickly deflect the hit and then strike at his chin and kick the knee furthest from me. His attention is off of me and his grip loosened, I push him away and get some much-needed space.

	“Fancy. Won’t help you much though,” he tells me angrily. I growl and decide to go on the offensive. With my palm, I strike him in the throat and then turn and deliver a back kick to whatever my foot hits first. I hear a grunt and a thud. It was time to end this.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

&lt;&lt;if $exorcism is 20&gt;&gt;\
	I steady myself and turn to the demon, doing my best to recall the exact words for the exorcism. I begin, finding a small bit of comfort in the shock that spreads across the demon’s face. His eyes widen, and he twitches slowly, a short trail of dark grey smoke seeping off of his body.
	
	I can already tell that I won’t be able to end this exorcism, forgetting the other half of it. I remember Bradley’s words about not attempting this if I’m not confident in the entire thing, as it will only piss the demon off more. I stop but as soon as I do, another voice chimes in to finish it. I look to see Bradley at my side as he ends exorcising the demon.
	
	“Seriously?” he questions, and I shrug nervously.
	
	“I almost had it,” I say, and he just rolls his eyes and goes back to the fight.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	I steady myself and turn to the demon. He rolls his neck around and then leaps towards me.
	
	“Syd, let me borrow that blade of yours,” I shout, but instead of giving it to me, she moves into my view, throwing one of her blades at the demon’s forehead. The demon looks to have a seizure before falling to the ground, dead. “Oh, because letting me hold it was just out of the question, huh?”
	
	“If anyone but me touch these blades, then they just turn into normal knives, so yea,” she tells me and then immediately goes back to join the fight. Well, now the question was where could I get a blade or two like those.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

[[Continue-&gt;TS5_2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1435" name="Throw holy water on him." tags="" position="2872,6014" size="100,100">I dart to the water bottle that I had kept nearby, quickly screwing off the top and then turning to him, splashing him with the contents. I do this countless times, ignoring his groans and whimpers as he tries to get away. These sounds only stopping when I run out of the water to throw.

&lt;&lt;if $style is &quot;Aikido&quot;&gt;&gt;\
	He recovers, but I’m already ready for him. I grab his forearm and then jam my elbow towards his chin, pushing him back until he falls over. His fall doesn’t last long, and he lunges, straight at me, but he doesn’t realize the gap. I swoop under the arm he doesn’t use and then grab his shoulder, slinging him to the ground.

	This time, I put more distance between the two of us, backing up as he pounds the ground in anger and then comes at me. He feints to the side, successfully gaining the upper hand as he punches my side and then trips me. I grab onto his shirt and yank as hard as I can, readjusting myself until I can catch his wrist, and then flip him easily.

	“Are you just going to keep flipping me?” he asks, darting towards me. I flip him again, but this time he grabs me, and I go down with him. I stomp my foot into his stomach as I try to separate myself from him.
&lt;&lt;elseif $style is &quot;Judo&quot;&gt;&gt;\
	I let him recover, preparing myself as he gets closer. He collides into me just as I plan and with a steady breath, I prepare myself. As soon as I can get my arms around his midsection, I hook my foot and trip him, leaning my weight so that I would end up falling on him.

	I quickly get back to my feet, finding him to be faster than me in that aspect. He throws his first punch, and then his second. I back away, continuing to dodge him as I go. Biding my time and searching for an opening. One presents itself, and as soon as he attempts to punch me again, I block the punch with my arm and move in, with the other arm, I sling it around his neck and back into him, tossing him to the ground.

	“I’ll rip you apart,” he screams, kicking my knee. I grit my teeth in pain, not being fast enough to avoid the punch that he lands to my cheek. I stumble backward, pushing away the pain. He lunges forward and grabs the side of my shoulder. I instantly put up my defenses before again putting my arm around him. I instinctively sweep his feet out, and with my arm still grasping his neck, I deliver punch after punch. It is only after about six of them that I decide to put space in between us, gathering myself as he groans on the ground from the assault.

“Hey, I //want// a demon killing blade,” I shout as I stagger to my feet, ignoring the pain shooting through my back.

“Why’s that?” Sydero asks, coming into view, dodging something before disappearing behind a wall, “tryna kill me, Roe?”

“Maybe,” I mumble, focusing back on the demon who doesn’t seem happy about me not taking our fight seriously. She rushes forward in rage, colliding with me and sending us both sliding across the less than smooth ceramic floor. I groan as I constantly slam my elbow into her back and the back of her neck, finally being able to breath when her grip loosens. I kick her and scramble away, touching my pockets and realizing that my weapons rested where I had initially been hit.

I glance around to assess my predicament. One of the openings out of the kitchen was nearby, but I would just end up running into a room full of angry supernatural creatures. Behind me were cabinets and I was pretty sure some of them had pans in them. And there was always me trying to get past her to get back to my weapons.

	I clear my throat and look over at the other two, both of them looking up at me at the same time.

	“You don’t need me, right, Sydero?” I question, and she raises a brow at me, and then at Asher. When she realizes what I’m alluding to, and why I’m asking, she rolls her eyes but smirks, shaking her head.

Asher leads me to a set of barracks that resides closer to the castle. There are only about three other houses set up here, and though they aren’t grand, they look better than most of the other huts that I had previously seen.

“This is where me and my partner, the blood assassin, lives. Also, two of Doran’s most trusted advisors.” I note that Asher speaks of his partner with a sorrowful look in his eye and tone.

“It seems like you miss your partner.”

He sends me a small smile, “I do. But at least I had someone else to hold my attention in their absence.” I roll my eyes playfully as he leads me inside. The room is oddly homey. A large wolf pelt lays on the ground, a dragon head is mounted on the wall, and three candles flicker in the corner. This room holds nothing but a dark wooden table and a couch that doesn’t look like it had been sat in for some time.

Asher continues to lead me through the house, not stopping until we arrive in what I presume to be his bedroom. A sizeable grand bed rests in the middle, covered by thick furs that would warm anyone up on a winter’s night. There is a single window on the left side of the wall, and a fireplace that I wonder if he uses. There is also a table and a chest on the far wall, papers scattered across the table, and clothing across the chest.

I wander to the window and take a deep breath. Why did I feel like I would miss this place?

		I chuckle nervously and tell him thank you, but add that I’d rather stay with the others. Knowing Sydero, it would take her half an hour to get this spell going, and it’d be just my luck that the spell was timed, and I’d be left behind.

		Asher nods understandably, straightening himself out before looking at all of us. “I will make sure no one disturbs you. It has been a pleasure meeting you all,” his gaze lingers on Chris who raises a brow at his previous words, “and I apologize for your treatment here.”

		“Yea, maybe this will make you think twice about just locking people up because of what they look like.”

		Asher dashes him a charming smile, “it won’t.” With a parting hug for me, he turns and leaves us to the spell.

	“I’m sure you can use the break,” I tell her, and she giggles softly in agreement.

	“I will make sure no one disturbs you,” her gaze lingers on Sydero who notices after a while and looks at her to see what she wanted, “I deeply apologize for how you were treated here. We’re better than that.”
		
	“Yea, no you’re not,” Sydero huffs, putting her attention back on the spell.
		
	Esther nods managing to still smile as she wraps me up in a tight goodbye hug, and then leaving us to the spell.

&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
“Will you read the book when you get back?” I hear Asher say behind me, and when I turn, jump in shock to see him standing right over me. He does so hesitantly, but he rests his hands on my hips gently, ready to pull them back if I show even the slightest sign of discomfort.

“That is a … good question. I don’t know. I feel like it’s going to be different, a whole other book.”

“You will have experienced the characters and the world for yourself, it does seem … fantastical,” he chuckles lowly. My cheeks heat up at the fond look in his eyes as if he’s dropping each and every defense he might’ve had up.

“And how about you?” I ask, resting my hand on his cheek, looking him deeply in the eyes. “How easy will it be for you to forget me?”

He moves his head and places a soft kiss that sends goosebumps running up me, and he squeezes my hand.

“I do not believe that can happen. There is something about you $name, something that makes me curse even the thought of forgetting you.” I blush at his words, not noticing that he had leaned in even more, his lips carefully meeting mine.

We both test the waters as if trying to figure out if this is what we wanted, if this was even a good idea. The more the seconds tick by, the more comfortable and confident we become, our bodies pressing closer until the only thing residing between us are our clothes. Asher makes sure he makes short work of the clothes, pulling them off of me before bringing me back towards him. I’m about to suggest moving this closer to the bed when I realize that he’s already doing so. He falls but his arms circle around me, lifting me up so that I fall gently on top of him. For a man that called himself an assassin, everything that he did was soft and gentle.
&lt;&lt;if $showec&gt;&gt;\
	
	&lt;&lt;if $a_gender is &quot;female&quot; or $gender is &quot;female&quot; or $gender is &quot;trans-female&quot;&gt;&gt;\
		That’s it. I remove my hand and flip us over so that I’m now on top. Asher looks shocked but says nothing. He brings me closer to him, laying kisses all along my body as he tightens his grip around me. He copied my moves from earlier as he slipped his hands into me, causing me to shiver in expectancy and sudden arousal. I kissed his neck as he worked his fingers inside me, adding another and then another. My mind was everywhere as I tried to continue kissing him, but my body simply wanted to live in the moment, live in the feel of his fingers inside me.

		All too soon, he removes them, and I turn my attention to his cock, taking in his size before lowering my mouth onto him. His hips buck immediately as I work, pacing myself and feeling his hands just inches away from my head. He moaned loudly, pushing his hips forward and causing me to ease up so that I didn’t choke. I use my other hand to press against his abdomen, calming him back down just enough to finish the job. I could taste his pre-cum on my lips, but we weren’t done yet.

		Thankfully, Asher had the same idea as me, grabbing my waist and pulling me up on him, only slowing down when I was hovering over his cock. He gently slid me down onto it, guiding his cock into me as we both adjusted to the feel.

		We both let out a hiss as I slid down, our movements slow as we still explore one another, but then the pace picks up. I clench my eyes closed as he runs his hand over the front of my clit, massaging it roughly and causing me to whimper loudly. I lean over and clutch the blankets, kissing him frantically, swallowing his groans as I felt him grow stiff.

		“$name,” he whispers against my lips, and I nod, pressing myself deeper into him, the ecstasy washing over me. Right before he was to cum, I move off of him and position myself to catch it, cleaning him up and feeling my high burst as well. He doesn’t miss a beat, cradling my body closer to his as his mouth explores my clit, tongue flickering as he tastes my juices.

		The two of us fall onto the bed, deep breathing as we let the moment wash over us.
	&lt;&lt;elseif $a_gender is &quot;male&quot; or $gender is &quot;male&quot; or $gender is &quot;trans-male&quot;&gt;&gt;\
		That’s it. I remove my hand and flip us over so that I was now on top. Asher looks shocked but says nothing. I lean in and growl into his ear, “flip over.” Immediately does as I ask. I run my hand along his sculpted back muscles, feeling him shiver underneath my touch. In an ideal world … my world, I would have immediately grabbed the lube but seeing that there was nothing of the sort here, I would have to improvise.

		I prep him, running my fingers along his ass before entering him, first with one then two fingers, then adding a third. I shiver myself when I hear him whimper underneath me. The more fingers I add, the louder his pleasurable whimpers get.

		“Shh,” I whisper into his ear, biting his earlobe teasingly. He nods obediently, and I wonder if I should’ve just kept my thoughts to myself, I was so enjoying the sounds of him whimpering as he allowed my fingers to fuck him. Curiosity and a need to tease him grew inside me as I curled my finger inside of him, basking in that sound that he made, even more shocked when I see part of him turn into a shadow before quickly manifesting back.

		He’s about to muster out an apology when I spread his cheeks and eased myself inside of him, allowing myself and him to adjust to the size and feel. His grip tightens even more on the blanket as he bit his lip in ecstasy, no longer caring about staying quiet. I’m sure if it were up to him, he would let the entire Dead Lands know that he was in here getting fucked. And I would be lying if I said that I wasn’t enjoying the sounds that were coming from him. I pull out and force my way back in, increasing my stroke each time.

		Asher growls backing into me and causing me to go deeper, and him to shout louder. After getting a decent pace going, I reach in front and grab onto his cock, running my hands up and down, fucking him harder. I busy my mouth on his back, kissing and nipping at his exposed skin. Asher braces himself, grunting in pleasure and then whimpering whenever he couldn’t hold his sounds of pleasure in any longer.

		“$name,” Asher whimpers loudly, and I can already tell that he was near the edge. I give him one last nip before speeding up my movements on his cock, encouraging him to cum as I slowly pull myself out of him. I rearrange us so that I could catch his cum when it came, cleaning him up and wrapping my arms around him.

		He breaths heavily in my arms, burrowing his head into my chest as he tries to gather his breath.

	An hour or so later I lay beside him, breathing deeply.

“Sure this won’t kill us?” I question Sydero, who doesn’t even look to have the energy to argue with me. She simply rolls her eyes before whispering a word, placing her bloody hand in the center of the circle that we stand in. I see a bright light, and a minute later, the feeling of falling once again upon me. I try to grab onto something, but my hand grasps nothing. My instincts kick in, terrified of what will happen once we land.

And then, everything vanishes.

	I sit on the bed, my heart racing as I gaze around the small motel room. Bradley is still in his bed, fast asleep, while Chris is deep breathing beside me, clutching the pillow close to him as he groans about something. Sydero snatches her pillow and hits Bradley with it, her cursing and the words she mutters, a bit more understandable than Chris’s.

	I sit on the bed, my heart racing as I gaze around the small motel room. Bradley is still in his bed, fast asleep, while Sydero sits up at attention, her eyes wide as she looks around. Her eyes catch mine before gazing over at Bradley. 

	“Are you kidding me!” she shouts, snatching her pillow and throwing it at Bradley.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

We spend the next minutes collecting our things and informing Bradley what had happened. To my amazement, he seems far more worried and embarrassed than fascinated. He sulks around with his head down, like a puppy that had just been scolded. I don’t have time to question him right now, I’ll do that at the next motel. We didn’t feel safe here, not knowing if the witch was the last one or not, or if someone else would come looking.

		“Why?” Chris questions.

		“I wish to have a moment of $name’s time is all,” Esther says, grabbing my hand and bringing me close in excitement, my hand slipping to her waist to calm her. Before I can say anything more, she yanks me out of the dungeon.
	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
	&lt;&lt;if $virgin&gt;&gt;\
		
		&quot;Hmm,&quot; I hear Syd hum as we leave, &quot;not a virgin for long.&quot; Half of me wants to go back in there and flick her off, the other just chuckles as I follow behind Esther.

&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

Esther leads me away from the dungeons and back to the castle, letting my hand go once we enter, assuming her role as a servant.

“This way,” she tells me with a goofy but shy smile. I roll my eyes as I continue to follow her, having to act as well. She takes me to a part of the castle that I haven’t been at, but once I see the other servants, I immediately figure out that we are where the servants of the castle rest their heads.

Many walk by without giving me a second glance, far too busy, and one track minded to care about what I was doing there. She leads me into a room, and I quickly go in, not wishing to ruin her reputation and have gossip spread. She looks around and closes the door, sighing heavily.

“I do not think the servants care, but I do hope we were able to get here without being spotted by any others.” I approach her and lift her hand to my lips, kissing it softly before raising my gaze to meet hers.

“I would hate to ruin your reputation, especially if I’m not here to defend it.” She giggles as I pull her closer, a bright blush decorating her golden cheeks.

“I do not usually partake in this,” she admits, “but, I would not be able to live with the thought of just letting you go so easily. When … when you were right here.”

I rest my hand on her cheek, staring into her eyes, at the gentle nature that existed there. She truly reminded me of a delicate flower that all should be content with looking at, not touching. A rose so pure and beautiful that it should be locked away. If only I could take her away from this place. But would my home even be better?

[[Continue-&gt;FC_EstherNight]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1443" name="FC_EstherNight" tags="" position="5311,4827" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;set $virgin = false&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;
“$name?” she questions, touching my cheek, gaining my attention, “sorry, it only seemed as if you had grown sad.”

“How can I be, when you’re right here?” I question, lightly kissing her fingertips.

“I will greatly miss you,” she whimpers, throwing her arms around my neck and hugging me tightly.

“Shh, let’s not think about that right now.” When she pulls back, she bites her lip and then throws her lips upon mine, pulling back a minute later in worry. I don’t give her time to doubt her movements, grabbing her jaw gently and bringing them back to my lips. I breathed in her scent, against being reminded of a fresh spring flower.

“Are you sure?” I ask, and Esther immediately nods.

“I am. I want this.” That was all she needed to say before my hands began to explore her body, feeling each and every perfection and flaw that she held. I slip her clothes off, peppering kisses along her collarbone and neck, and then her cheeks and jaw. She brings me closer as I gently lay her against the bed.

&lt;&lt;if $showec&gt;&gt;\
	My hands move over her breasts as my kisses go lower, always two places behind my hands. As they travel to her abdomen, I rest my lips against her breasts, toying with her nipples and listening to her to hear how she reacts to everything. I immediately find out that she is a sensitive young woman, just breathing against her had her shivering.

	I press my lips back to hers, savoring the feeling of her soft against mine. , even more, her gasp as I toy with her clit, smirking as her back arches and she whimpers loudly when I stop.

	“Shh,” I tell her, kissing her cheek and then making my way back down her body until I’m hovering over her core. I toy with her at first to get a reaction, before placing my tongue up against her, eating her and tasting what she had to offer.

	“$name,” she hisses, or whimpers, I couldn’t quite tell. I feel her hand touch the back of my head as she urges me to go faster, deeper. I oblige, flickering my tongue against her and listening to every sound that was for me, though others were probably hearing.

	&lt;&lt;if $a_gender is &quot;male&quot; or $gender is &quot;male&quot; or $gender is &quot;trans-male&quot;&gt;&gt;\
		Once done, she yanks me back up to her, kissing me desperately as her hands now roam to my member, her hand barely grazing it before she holds it and begins to pump her hands up and down. I growl into her mouth, pushing myself into her as she sped up her movements. I could do nothing but focus on kissing her, nipping and touching all of her sensitive areas. I could feel myself coming to the edge and didn’t wish to not have her join me.

		With a smirk, I stop her, ignoring the confused look she sends me as I kiss her, once then twice. I spread her legs, and her eyes widen in understanding, right as I insert myself into her tight hole. She yelps in ecstasy, her body shaking as I slowly push deeper into her.

		“$name!” she shouts, her fingers grabbing onto my arms as I increase my pacing, my strokes going deeper each time. Her body arches forward, and I capture her right tit in my mouth, flicking my tongue across her hard nipple as she moans.

		“Hmm,” I hum satisfied as we both reach that peak, “are you ready?” I question, and she nods quickly. I smile and speed up, though I continue to push myself deep into her with every thrust. Suddenly, I tense up, and I come out, exploding over her before bringing his tongue back to taste her juices. She moves as well, cleaning my member up before collapsing onto the bed, both of us breathing deeply.  
	&lt;&lt;elseif $a_gender is &quot;female&quot; or $gender is &quot;female&quot; or $gender is &quot;trans-female&quot;&gt;&gt;\
		Once done, she yanks me back up to her, kissing me desperately as her hands now roam to my clit, rubbing it in circular motions before inserting her fingers. I somehow giggle up against her lips.

		“Are you copying me?” I question, arching ever so slightly due to the feeling.

		“You are a good teacher,” she whispers, and I roll my eyes though I don’t argue. Esther positions herself differently so that she was now between my legs, and though she does excellent work, I begin to miss the feel of her lips against mine. I gasp when her lips go somewhere else though, her breath triggering me to shiver as she sucks and licks at my swollen clit. I try to contain myself, not wanting to arch into her face too much. And before I can, she grabs onto my thighs as she goes deeper, her tongue working miracles I didn’t know were possible. 

		As her tongue did this, her fingers went to my breasts, pinching my swollen nipples until suddenly I felt myself orgasming. My body spasming as she licked up my juices.

		“I give that performance an A,” I manage to say, and Esther laughs from beside me, cuddling up closer, kissing my neck lazily.
	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

	“I shall never forget you,” she whispers, and I smile, planting a kiss on her head. She nods off to sleep later, and sadly, I don’t wake her as I leave.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	An hour or so later I lay beside her, breathing deeply.
	
	“I shall never forget you,” she whispers, and I smile, planting a kiss on her head. She nods off to sleep later, and sadly, I don’t wake her as I leave.

“Alright, time to tell me what this attitude of yours is about. We’ve literally just been transported in and out of a book, and the one thing that you manage to keep is your attitude.”

“Walk away, $name,” he mumbles, kicking a group of rocks away from him.

“No. Not until you come clean about the origins of your pissy attitude.” He sits quietly, perhaps trying to ignore me, or get his words together.

Either way, when he finally does look my way, he scowls before saying, “you’re good at this shit.” I raise a brow, looking around as if someone else was going to just appear and tell me what he meant by that.

“Excuse me?”

“This whole, hunting thing. We practically got into it at the same time and yet, you look like you’ve been doing it for years. While I’m definitely still a novice.”

“So, let me get this straight. You’re mad because I’m doing a good job of staying alive?” Chris groans as he stands and begins to pace, suddenly stopping and turning to me.

“Just forget it. I hate talking about shit, let’s just act like I stubbed my toe and forget all this.”

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1445" name="Sydero is off to the side" tags="" position="5621,4503" size="100,100">I approach Sydero whose glaring at the vending machine as if it ate her dollar, on second thought, it might have.

“Did it eat your dollar?” I ask, and she jumps, eyes wide when she notices I’m there. Her jump makes me jump, and we both stare at each other in minor shock.

“Sorry,” she grumbles, “didn’t hear you walk up.”

“That’s a first.”

“It is, isn’t it?” she grumbles lowly, “no, though. It didn’t eat my dollar, but it is eating my patience. I have no idea what I want. I’m not really good at these things.”

“Vending machines?”

“Picking sodas. Believe it or not, I don’t really drink them. I either go for alcohol or just settle on water. Sometimes fruit juices.”

“That’s one of the biggest extreme jumps ever but okay.” I look at what the machine had, telling her to choose the only decent one there.

Once she gets her soda, she takes a long swig and shrugs, giving me a thumbs up.

&lt;&lt;if $Cimmerian&gt;&gt;\
	“So, Doran, did it ever happen?”
	
	&lt;&lt;if $SRomance &gt;=5&gt;&gt;\
		Sydero takes another sip of her soda and looks over at me, “do you really want to know?” I bite the inside of my cheek, feeling my heart rock back and forth in curiosity, but also because it was preparing itself to be heartbroken. I knew Sydero wasn’t mine, but that didn’t mean I wanted her less. And to think, that even when she knew about my feelings, that she would still turn and seek out the pleasures of another, it made me just feel … discombobulated.

		Yet, that was the thing. She was single, and so was I. She held no allegiance to me, no promise to stay faithful. Did I even have a right to ask? Suddenly, I hear a loud noise and come back to see her lowering her hands, raising a brow.

		“Sorry, I zoned out.”

		“Hmm? Imagining me, you, some chocolates, and a night to ourselves?”

		“Not really,” I mumble. She snorts and finishes the soda in her hands. She still hadn’t answered me, and the longer she refused to respond, the more I felt like I already knew the answer.

		She goes to the recycling bin and throws the can in, turning to look at me, “I already told you, Roe. Me and you won’t happen. So, let it go.” She walks into our motel room, leaving me without an answer, but a feeling.
		
		I head in a few minutes after her, making sure not to make eye contact with her as I head towards a bed. I had a headache, and my body was exhausted, I wished to sleep, for it to claim me and let me forget about the world, to forget about her.
	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
		“You mean Person 781?” she sneers.

		“Please tell me that’s not how many people you’ve actually had sex with.”

		“Of course not … though that does give me an idea for a new goal,” she jokes, or at least I hope she does, “but honestly, it actually didn’t take as long as I thought, which made it boring. But I have no regrets. At least I can say I was able to seduce a dark lord.” I roll my eyes and laugh alongside her as we head inside. Sydero heads towards one of the free seats beside Bradley while I immediately claim a bed, while sleep claims me.

	“Bradley,” I begin, and he immediately cuts me off, wiping away tears that had yet to be shed.

“Not gonna happen, so unless you want me to be even more annoying. Explain yourself.”

Chris growls loudly before beginning, “how many times have you needed saving since this began?” I think back on it, there was the whole restaurant and Morgan business, and I couldn’t forget about the faeries, but I’m pretty sure that was it. Any other time I held my own as best as I could. I say this to Chris, and he claps his hands as if I had just figured out the key to life.

“Exactly, then you have me. I got kidnapped by werewolves, by faeries, there was the bar thing, and I almost got turned into a freaking monster. Then there were the witches earlier and even the witch in the story. I’m … I’m sick of being dead weight,” he says, collapsing back down and hiding his face. “And no matter what I do, I don’t think I’ll ever be ready for this.”

“You can’t compare yourself to me, or anyone for that matter. We’re taking this differently is all.”

“Your past is way more traumatic than mine though, you’d think I’d be taking to this better.”

I sigh and shrug, “well, no offense, but you haven’t had to work for what you got. Not saying you haven’t had your trials, but compared to some, you’ve skated by easily. In a life like this, that’s a weakness, not a good thing.” Chris thinks about my words and nods. Giving me a small smile, though it dies a minute later.

“Thanks, $name. But I think I just want to think and be alone.” I nod and pat his shoulders, rising and walking off. Whatever else he needed to go through; he would have to do that alone. This was one insecurity I couldn’t help him through. I head inside and make a beeline for one of the free beds. As soon as my head hits the pillow, sleep claims me.

We sit in a small diner, everyone but me looking like they had just got out of bed. Sydero is literally still wearing her pajamas, some highly comfortable looking sweatpants, and a tank top.

This was all to say that I was the only one who looked put together, which wasn’t much of a choice. I had some glasses on and a hat, along with some jeans and a hoodie in case I needed to hide who I was even more.

One of the waitresses that walk by gives me a raised brow, and Bradley chimes in to rescue me.

“$He just had eye surgery and currently going through a horrible hair day. We’re hoping this breakfast turns that day around.” She nods uncaringly and gets our drinks before disappearing.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“Not that I’m upset about getting breakfast, but is the only reason we’re here really because Bradley threw an immature tantrum?” Chris questions, still looking over the menu in his hands.

	“You got-damn right it is, do you see this face,” Bradley asks.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“So are we here just because Bradley wanted to eat breakfast?” I ask.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“No, we’re not here just because of Bradley. This also seemed like the best way to have a meeting about what our next move is.”

“It’s not to lay low again?” I ask, and she shakes her head.

“We haven’t run into Raum since that bar accident, and I’m getting antsy. Last time he disappeared for too long, Roe became wanted across the eastern states.” She had a point.

“So, what do you want to do about that?” Bradley questions.

“I have something that can track him.”

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“And you just now bring this up?” Chris inquires.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“And you just now bring this up?” I inquire.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“Well, that’s the catch,” she says in embarrassment, “I lost the bowl a long time ago. But I just got a tip from an associate that they know where to find it.”

“This seems so sketchy,” I moan.

“Look, the bowl is helpful, and I know where to find it now. Any of you have a better idea?” Of course, we don’t. And with that, Sydero smiles in triumph.

“Where are we headed to then?” I question.

“Ayden, North Carolina.”

“Go to sleep Bradley.” He doesn’t smile, but he nods as he closes his laptop and heads to the bed. In fact, all of us needed to just go to sleep. Though, I’m sure none of us trusted the idea of all of us going to sleep at the same time. Sydero would walk in later, I know if anybody would stay up, it would be her.

My body goes into a state of emergency, every limb thrashing to escape the grip that was killing me.

	“Fight all you want,” she growls, her claws digging into my throat, feeling as if they were puncturing flesh. I scream in pain and kick wildly. I just need a tiny pinch of luck, only a tiny.

	That luck comes with a lucky placed kick to the woman’s stomach that has her grip falter, enough for me to separate myself from her. I blindly push her back and stumble backward. I painfully try to catch my breath and regain a vision that swims about chaotically. I touch my throat and feel a warm liquid coat the tip of my fingers.

	“Bradley, a little assistance!” I shout, barely dodging the woman as she tries to grab and punch me. She catches my shirt and slings me into the refrigerator, holding me up by the throat as she tightens her grip. My vision begins to dance and blur at the edges as I continue to fight for air, clawing her hands, and having her ignore me.

	“Guess what?!” I hear Bradley shout and then hear the woman scream in agony, releasing me immediately. I gasp for air, trying to figure out where I am when I hear Bradley sing, “holy water, bitch!”

	“Is that your new line or something?”

	“Hell yea, epic, isn’t it?” Bradley asks, helping me to my feet. “your throat doesn’t look too bad, but you might want to avoid getting choked again.”

		I nod my thanks and send Bradley back out, shouting for him to be careful.

	I expect for Bradley to show up, but he doesn’t, and the grip only gets tighter. My body goes into a state of emergency, every limb thrashing to escape the hold that was killing me.

	“Fight all you want,” she growls, her claws digging into my throat, feeling as if they were puncturing flesh. I scream in pain and kick wildly. I just need a tiny pinch of luck, only a tiny.

	That luck comes with a lucky placed kick to the woman’s stomach that has her grip falter, enough for me to separate myself from her. I blindly push her back and stumble backward. I painfully try to catch my breath and regain a vision that swims about chaotically. I touch my throat and feel a warm liquid coat the tip of my fingers.

	When I’m finally able to get back to my feet, I have only a split second to react as the woman is once again upon me. I dive out of the way, ignoring the sharp pain in my arm as it scrapes against something. I unsteadily get to my feet and face the woman.

	Suddenly, the woman’s grip disappears, and I hear her scream as I fall to the ground. I gasp for air, trying to figure out where I am. When I finally get my bearings back, I spot Sydero approaching me, the woman on the other side of the kitchen, a decently sized hole in the wall where I believe she hit.

	“Why didn’t you just knife her?” I question, coughing.

	“Both of my blades are preoccupied right now,” she growls and looks behind her, “you can take her, right?” I get to my feet and look over at the woman.

	“About time you show up,” I sigh, and the smoky tendril turns as if it’s looking at me.

	The tables were turned, and I was now on the offensive. I stalk towards her as she backs away, slashing her every chance I got. The pain was short-lived thanks to her demonic nature, but as long as there was pain, then I was okay.

	I dodge her countless times, continuing to get closer and swipe at her before retreating again. She was getting tired, and her clothes were becoming stained with blood. Whereas I was just getting started.

	I go in for another swipe, and she lands a lucky grab, catching my wrist and wrestling the knife from my hold and pushing me away. I stop and tackle her, causing the blade to skid across the ground, out of both of our reach. With the blade again out of play, I back up.

“Think this will kill me?” I glance everywhere as she continues to laugh, reaching forward and grabbing a water bottle half filled with water that was hopefully purified.

Blocking his punches and acting as if they didn’t hurt, even while I blocked them. I realize that I could just have him hit the wall, seeing that he was focused entirely on me.

		But I don’t have time to do anything else as he grabs my wrist, flipping me over him, and then throwing me to the side. I try to regain focus, though Langston isn’t a significant threat just yet. He’s still trying to get over having his face bashed into the floor.

Blocking his punches and acting as if they didn’t hurt, even while I blocked them. I realize that I could just have him hit the wall, seeing that he was focused entirely on me. Keeping a straight face, I back into the wall, my eyes widening in shock as he grins, and he winds up for the next punch. At the last moment, I move, his fist making a massive impact with the wall.

I spit out the blood that gathers in my mouth, feeling his hand grab me before launching me across the kitchen. I try to regain focus before Langston can make his way to me.

My fight or flight instincts have been cut off, and my body simply wants to sleep. Not just that, I still feel euphoric, as if I had just finished smoking the best drugs known to man. The feeling is all over me, causing me to feel a tingling sensation in my toes and fingertips. It almost makes the pain hurt that much less.

I have to focus though … but I can’t. I know that much as my eyes drift up and my head lolls to the side. //No, not with Langston right there. Not with him so close.//

But now, now the feeling overwhelmed all of my senses. I feel someone grab me, my brain lazily coming up with the distorted figure of Langston.

	“Oh, seems like someone’s out of it,” he chuckles, and something strikes me over and over. The pain registers for a minute before the feeling blocks it out again. This was going to be how I died, that was all I could manage to think as I felt my body slump against the floor.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	I whimper but then mentally curse myself for even letting this overtake me. I growl and with all my power, push myself up to my feet. I fight myself in every possible way, focusing on specific things, tiny things before making out larger things. I take baby steps and they prove to get me back to almost aware. I can at least see again, feel and sense the world around me.

	Just in time, I see Langston approaching and I lunge for him, catching him unaware due to my previous lethargic actions. I bring my fist against his face again and again, taking out every bit of anger I had on his face, blocking out the sounds of the others fighting, others screaming, everything.

	Looking at Langston now, it was almost hard to actually identify him. His face was covered in blood and sweat, so much hate resided in those blue eyes, blue eyes that usually were paired with a smirk or easy smile. A part of me was delighted that I was the one that wiped that smile off his face.

	I stagger towards him, yelling as I struck him again. The first punch was for my uncle, the next was for Chris, the third for him even daring to wear my skin, the fourth for committing crimes and making me wanted, the fifth for making me fake my own death, the sixth for Morgan, and the seventh, well the seventh was purely for him existing. Langston raised his hands in surrender, blood poured from his nose and mouth, and it stained almost all of his face. One eye was swollen, and the other was almost there.

	Looking at Langston now, it was like I had barely injured the man. I could barely see him with one of my eyes swollen, this feeling overtaking me, and all of my other injuries.

	“You’re pathetic,” he tells me, and I tremble as he approaches, appearing dissatisfied with his day.

	“Why Raum doesn’t just kill your pestering ass, I will never know.” He grabs my shirt and brings me close, “if I can’t kill you then I’m going to sure as hell make you pay.”

		“Like hell,” I hear the Entity roar, and though my vision doesn’t falter, I’m suddenly aware that I’m not in control of my own body. Langston’s eyes widen in terror, and I look down, barely seeing the black misty tendril that is going through him.

		“Funny,” the Entity chuckles, Langston’s eyes grew even wider when he realizes that it’s not me as well.
		
		“I was thinking the same thing about you.” The Entity pulls the tendril out of Langston, and he immediately falls to the ground. He tries to cover up the hole now in his body, shrieking softly at suddenly being face to face with death. And, before I can even say anything, the Entity relinquishes control back to me. The feeling from earlier overtakes me again, and I realize, Langston is now dead. He was gone.

		I stumble backward. I was exhausted, but I didn’t know what was going on out there, seeing that I had been stuck inside this kitchen for so long. I take numerous deep breaths and stagger towards the others. Only then noting the quiet that came over the house.
	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
		And he does just that, he slams me into the wall, my eyes rolling to the top of my head as he does the action again and again. I moan in pain as he punches me, the assault not stopping no matter how much I wish it would.

		And then suddenly, I’m no longer conscious.

		When I come back to the now, Langston is no longer there, and I’m unaware of just how long I’ve been out of it. I push myself to my feet, aware of how quiet the house is, and seek out the others.

He didn’t have the energy to move, but he did look at me as if hoping that the look in his eyes would change my mind. It did the opposite. Tears rushed down my face as everything I had to endure because of this man came to mind. He opened his mouth to plead for his life, but before he could even mutter a syllable, I pulled the trigger, again and again.

His body jumped at the impact of the bullet hitting his heart, and as he chokes on his own blood, I realize that I had killed him. The gun drops to the floor as I stare on.

The feeling of him dying at my own deeds felt like cold water washing over me on the hottest day on record, bathing me in relief. The tears disappeared, and I suddenly felt nothing but power.

I glanced down at the still body … I killed Langston.

Realizing what I was about to do, he quickly reached out and grabbed my wrists, but before he could find purchase, I headbutt him, not even feeling the pain afterward due to the furor that runs through my veins. The excitement of finally being able to kill him, make him pay, have him realize that some pointless, insignificant human is what ended his life.

I plunge the knife down with a yell, pushing it into his heart with all of my might, ignoring the sound of him choking on his own blood. Not stopping until he had died, his eyes wide open as he stared up at the ceiling.

	“Where’s Sydero?”

	“Right here,” she replies, walking into the house, twirling her blades rapidly, allowing the blood to splatter from it to the wall and floor. I watch as she places one blade on top of the other, and a bright light shines right as they meld into one. She looks over at me, taking in my appearance before looking away, not saying anything.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	I stumble into the living room, tripping over two bodies on my way. When I regain my footing, I see no one. Great, perfect time to take a breather. I sit on the ruined sofa, my head rolling to the side as I try and focus on everything that had just happened.

	I jump, my eyes shooting to the noise near the door, calming down when I see Sydero standing there. She looks at me, looking me over with a critical eye before putting her attention on her blades. She first twirls her blades rapidly, allowing the blood to splatter from it to the wall and floor. I watch as she places one blade on top of the other, and a bright light shines right as they meld into one.

		“Well, I’d be damned, Roe, look who went and became a badass.” I manage a small smile, but that’s it, still too weak.

	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
		“I think so, though I can’t find Langston and Petri anywhere. I’m guessing they ran as soon as possible.”

“Where’s Bradley?” I ask, and Sydero looks around, rolling her eyes annoyed.

“Bradley, you can come out of hiding.” Silence.

“Bradley,” she shouts, wandering upstairs, deftly jumping past the bodies that lie dead there. I silently wait to hear the young boy chuckling or Sydero going off on him. I hear neither. Instead, I hear her rush down the stairs.

“Bradley?” Sydero shouts, this time in more haste. We all race around, trying to find the boy and hoping that he was just hiding somewhere. As I’m leaving the kitchen, I trip over something solid and turn to see the culprit was Bradley’s bookbag. I tremble as I open it, knowing that if a particular item is in here, then it would answer all the questions. And there it was, his laptop sitting, waiting to be brought back to life.

“Syd,” I whisper and turn to her, showing her the laptop in my hands. She says nothing, she doesn’t even move to come closer. She just stares at the computer dangling in my one hand, not blinking, only trembling.

The ringtone unmistakably Bradley’s as it plays a recording of Chris’s scream put to a dubstep beat. I roll my eyes on instinct, my stomach churning as I think about Bradley’s fate and whereabouts.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	We both jump at the sound of a phone going off, the ringtone unmistakably Bradley’s as it plays a recording of a fast pace dubstep.

“How’d you know it was me?” Raum asks, it almost sounded like he was pouting.

“You’re not as crafty as you think you are,” Sydero responds, attempting to get her temper back under control, “you forced Bradley to give you his number. Not hard to figure out. Now, what I can’t figure out is why you didn’t waltz in here yourself if you were so close. Scared of something, Raum?”

He chuckles deeply, sighing thoughtfully for a second. “I’m not as much as an idiot as you might’ve thought. And if you haven’t figured out what’s going to happen out by now, then shame on you.”

“Does that sate your curiosity, $name? Or do you want to talk to him some more.” I keep quiet.

“Meet us in Ayden, every hour you’re not here, the boy gets closer to death.”

And just like any villain, he hangs up. The only difference between Raum and movie villains is that Raum was earnest. He wasn’t above harming an innocent teenager. Even more so, I wouldn’t put it past Raum to actually kill the kid.

“First off, what do we know?” I ask, and we all begin to answer. This was a trap, they knew Sydero was weak, Raum wanted Sydero, so that was his primary goal. We quietly sit and think about all of the things we pointed out, none of us successfully being able to come up with a plan that might work. In the end, we realize one thing.

We hardly knew shit.

“So you actually have a name?”

“No,” he laughs and rolls his eyes as he begins to disappear, “I was just created to be called silly things by silly little creatures such as yourself.”

“Ready?” I ask, turning to face her as I stand near the door, my pack slung over my shoulder.

“Hell yea,” Sydero mumbles, zipping up Bradley’s duffle bag and then sliding past me and towards the car, “let’s go get our geek back.” 

&lt;&lt;link [img[images/divider.png]] &gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/link&gt;&gt;

	Oh jeez. It was still hard to believe that they had grabbed the kid.

	“Sydero, stop! Stop,” he shouts, turning to me, “$name, help?”

	“What is there to think about?” Sydero shouts, turning to me, waiting to hear what I had to say, though she doesn’t even wait long enough for me to answer, “nothing. The only thing we need to be concerned about is going and grabbing Bradley.” She continues to grab stuff, the last thing she picks up are my keys, looking from them to me.

	“I’m going to go get Bradley, with or without you. What’s it gonna be, Roe?”

	I take a deep breath and grab my keys from her, “just pass me my gun.” She nods and hands it to me, both of us looking Chris’s way. He growls and mumbles something but checks his gun, nodding at the both of us.
	
	The safehouse was totally trashed, looking like Bradley’s old place before the werewolves got their hands on it. As I load the car up with all of our stuff, and I mean all of it, Sydero stares at the house. I expect to see even a gleam of sadness, something that would prove that this place was essential to her in some shape or form. But there’s no identifiable emotion in her eyes. Instead, there are emotions that I can’t touch. I open the door, ready to shout to her that we were prepared, but she was already walking back towards us.

	“Maybe we should stop and think this through,” I start, Sydero shoving past me as I get in her way, ultimately trying to get her to stop. She was about to do something irrational and profoundly stupid.

	“Sydero, just stop. Stop!” I shout, and she whips around to face me.

I glance over at Sydero and though the road in front of us is dark, and she stares forward. The same fire behind us reflects in her eyes.

	“Yea, straight into Raum’s ass,” Sydero growls, throwing me my keys as I throw her an extra ammo cartridge.

	“I’m not going to win this,” I hear Chris say, but neither of us responds, that much should’ve been obvious. We continue to gather our things, Chris joining in with us.

They were little sacks filled with a mixture of things that I didn’t get a good look at. Between getting the motel room and unpacking the essentials, I didn’t have much time to sneak a peek at what she was doing.

We were on the outskirts of Aspen, not wanting to go any closer just in case Raum had people posted. It was even more shocking that Sydero had agreed to stop. We were counting each hour, our hands growing antsier and our dispositions creeping closer to the edge.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“We need a plan,” Chris finally says, I wonder how long he’s been holding that one in, “we just can’t run in there blind.”

	“No thanks,” Sydero responds blatantly, “any plan we’ve ever come up with has blown up in our face.”

	“This one won’t,” he tells her, and I understand why he thinks such a thing.

	“And why not?” she questions, far too calmly for either of our tastes.

	“Because this is such an obvious trap that even calling it a trap is stupid. Raum holds all the cards, and we know that. Previously, we were on equal ground, we held some cards, and so did he. This time, we’re at the bottom of a trench, and he’s on the top of Mount Kilimanjaro.”

	“Remind me how this is supposed to get me on board the Plan Train?”

	“Because any other time, we couldn’t guess all the possibilities Raum would try,” I add, “but this time, we know how careful we have to be. He holds the cards, but we have what he wants, you. Regardless of what he says, he knows as well as us that if he kills Bradley, then it’s done with.”

	&lt;&lt;if $langstonFree&gt;&gt;\
		“You forget that he has a shapeshifter,” Sydero growls, her eyes narrowing on me as she reminds me about what had happened.

		“I did what I did,” I mumble, and she paces back and forth furious.
		
		&lt;&lt;if $uncledead&gt;&gt;\
			“And your actions were the stupidest thing you could do. You forget? He killed your uncle?” My blood rises as I rise to meet her, both of us staring at one another.
		&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
			“Yea, we know. We all saw. The dude wears your skin and commits murder and other crimes. And Roe’s logic? Let him go.” My blood rises as I rise to meet her, both of us staring at one another.
		&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

		Chris sighs dramatically, “this is getting us nowhere, certainly not closer to saving Bradley.”

		“Yea, Sydero, unless you want to continue playing the blame game. Or, must I remind you all the times that you fucked up?” A sinister smirk appears as she yields. I guess there’s a first for everything.
	&lt;&lt;elseif $langstonDead&gt;&gt;\
		“You’re right,” Sydero sighs, visibly trying to calm down, “you’re right. We just need to play this smart.” She begins to pace slowly. 
	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
		“You forget that he has a shapeshifter,” Sydero growls, “he could easily wear Bradley’s skin.”

		“Well, can’t you sense the energy of a shapeshifter?” My words remind her, and she nods, grumbling at the fact that she had brought up a pointless statement. That, and if we didn’t see Langston anywhere, then we wouldn’t go any closer as well.
	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

	We hardly knew shit.

	“This isn’t working,” Sydero growls, the sound so deep that I think she’s going demonic, “it’s exactly what you said, we hold no cards. There’s no way we can plan for this. We need more information.”

	I nod in agreement, “how about this then. Chris, you take my car and go find out if you can find exactly where they are. If Sydero or I go, they might be able to sense us. Sydero, you stay and figure out if you can do anything more with your bowl. I’ll go to the store and get us some things we’ll definitely need.” They both agree with me, and I’m just happy that the store is right up the street. At least this will give us each something to do, and we’ll get a break from each other.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“We need a plan,” I finally say, “we just can’t run in there blind.”

	“And where are you going?”

	“Funny,” the Entity chuckles, Langston’s eyes grew even wider when he realizes that it’s not me as well.
		
	“I was thinking the same thing about you.” The Entity pulls the tendril out of Langston, and he immediately falls to the ground. He tries to cover up the hole now in his body, shrieking softly at suddenly being face to face with death. And, before I can even say anything, the Entity relinquishes control back to me. The feeling from earlier overtakes me again, and I realize, Langston is now dead. He was gone.

	I stumble backward. I was exhausted, but I didn’t know what was going on out there, seeing that I had been stuck inside this kitchen for so long. I take numerous deep breaths and stagger towards the others. Only then noting the quiet that came over the house.

I wouldn’t feed whatever beast that was. I push myself away from Langston’s body, feeling even dizzier now that I was sitting. I don’t know what Langston will do, but when I open my eyes, I find him gone. His blood is the only indication that he had ever been there.

I don’t even know if other hunters and specialists would believe me, this seemed pretty farfetched.

		“I would like to think it’s just my great personality,” I joke, trying to get her to smile.
		
		She manages a small one, but it disappears immediately as she focuses in on the floor, “$name,” she begins. “Would you like to … go somewhere alone?” I raise a brow and look over at her.
		
		“What do you mean?”
		
		“A minute that neither of us would forget, just you and me?” My eyes widen once I understand what Esther was talking about. Her eyes going back towards the entrance.

		“I’m sure you can use the break,” I tell her, and she giggles softly in agreement.

I stare up at the darkening sky. The moon absent as only the stars begin to show their face. I know what tonight’s moon was, and yet here I was, hoping that astrology sources were false and that the moon would show itself.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	I search the skies foolishly before turning my attention back to the motel, the door open as my team hustles about inside, making sure everything was in order. My stomach was in turmoil, nervous energy pumping alongside my blood as I grab my bag. I check my gun and its bullets, tap my side for my trusty blade, and then check to make sure that the anti-possession charm, that Bradley had given me, still adorns my neck.
	
	“Everyone ready?” Chris asks, turning to face us as he stands near the door, his pack slung over his shoulder.

	“Hell yea,” Sydero mumbles, zipping up Bradley’s duffle bag and then sliding past Chris and towards the car, “let’s go get our geek back.” I smirk as Chris and I follow her out and then hop into the car.

The car ride is entirely silent, the only sound coming from the wind, getting in through the partially cracked windows. The cold gust of wind strikes me gently. Tonight would make for a beautiful evening out. The sun hadn’t yet set but was preparing itself, wanting to stay and watch the sky react to its departure.

I was beyond the scope of nervous, words not being able to describe what I was feeling.

&lt;&lt;if $optimistic &gt;= 50&gt;&gt;\
	The negative and doubting thoughts began to creep forward, but I immediately shoved them away. This was not what I should be worrying about. If I didn’t keep some sort of positive behavior, then I would put myself in a hole that I won’t be able to crawl out. I attempt to think of some positive thoughts and fail, there was nothing positive about this. The only positive thing that I could think of was all of us making it out, whether worse for wear or not, we would make it out. I cling to that.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	What if something went wrong, which for us, was bound to happen. We could lose someone. What if Bradley was already dead, what if Raum was actually serious about harming him every hour that we failed to show? What if … so many what ifs and so many ways that this could turn out wrong. Even with us checking every base, bringing up every way that this could go wrong, and telling ourselves that we would have to be on our toe, this was still a suicide mission.

The Entity’s … Zillah’s words repeat in my head as I drive closer to the neighborhood. Was I willing to put myself into this much danger for them? Was I ready to potentially die, just for a chance that they could live? Especially with our odds, we might all just end up dead.

“Just drive,” Sydero whispers from beside me. I glance over at her, raising a brow at her choice of words and her timing. “Your thoughts are the loudest thing right now, they’re all over your face.”

[[“Are we ready for this?”]]

“Can anyone be ready for this?” Sydero questions, lazily looking over at me before placing her attention back on the window.

“Point, I suppose.” I rest my head on the seat’s headrest, my heart thumping louder as I turn down the street belonging to the neighborhood.

She was wrong, my heart was the loudest thing.

I head down the quiet streets, trying to figure out where I should park. As far as I knew, people still lived in these neighborhoods. And all of their bodies had probably been taken hostage by demons. I zoom down another street, slamming on the breaks as a man darts across the street at the wrong time, though I suppose if I was going the speed limit, then all of this could be avoided. The strangest part was that as the man and I make eye contact, I recognize him.

“Jeff?” I question, unbuckling my seatbelt and getting out of the car in confusion and wonder. My drunken prison neighbor stands before me, in much better clothing than when I last saw him in, and appearing sober, though who knew how long that would last.

“Well, I be damned. $name! How are ya?” he questions as he shakes my hand roughly.

&lt;&lt;if $freejeff&gt;&gt;\
	“I’m fine,” I say, looking over at Sydero who blows the horn impatiently, “sorry, Jeff. I can’t really catch up right now. We’re on our way to handle something.”

	&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
		“I wouldn’t go past that neighborhood there, too many demons.” I freeze. Sydero freezes. Chris freezes. All eyes on Jeff.

		“Demons? As in, actual demons?” I question, and Jeff looks at me as if I’m the crazy one.

		“Yes, demons, from hell,” he squints and sighs, approaching me and placing his hand on my shoulder, “listen, kid. Demons are real, they exist and live amongst us. It’s a lot to take in, but you’re gonna have to live with it.” Suddenly, Sydero’s way of breaking the news that supernatural creatures exist to me seems a whole lot nicer. I roll my eyes and move his hand.

		“That was a horrible way to break the news to someone.”

		“How the hell do you know about demons?” Sydero asks, getting out of the car and leaning on the door, eyeing him up and down.

		He snorts, “I ain’t some ignorant man. I know about all of that dark crap. I don’t ever walk around without protection.” He flips his wrist over, and I see a small anti-possession tattoo there along with a few other symbols decorating his arm. My eyes widen as I look from him to Sydero who&#39;s looking him over critically.

		“Sydero, is he?” I’m unable to finish my sentence, Sydero shaking her head.

		“No. He’s human.” Sydero looks over at me with a raised brow, “how did you say you knew him?”

		“I’m right here,” he sings and points at himself, “we met in prison, and my buddy here helped me out.”

		“That’s all well and good, but what did you say earlier?” Chris questions, “about not going down that road?”

		“Demons,” Jeff replies, enunciating the word as if Chris was deaf, “the bastards moved in a few days ago like they own the block. Hate those black-eyed fools.” Jeff continues to rant about how much he hates demons and how much he also hated the neighborhood. I turn to my group, wanting to know what we were going to do with this new information.

		“We don’t have much time,” Chris tells us, both of us looking at the sky.

		“Yea, but we’ve just been handed some massive info,” I point out, looking to Sydero who sits quietly on the hood of my car.

	“Nice to see you again,” Sydero sighs as she gets out next, nodding to Jeff and giving me an impatient look.

	“Wait, you know Jeff?”

	“Who do you think let him out of his cell?” she asks and Jeff bursts into obnoxious laughter.

	“That was fun. Thanks for burning that hell hole down by the way.”

	“So, he saw your whole demonic freakout?” I question.

	“Indeed, and he wasn’t the least bit shocked?” Sydero sends him a look that he only laughs at, slapping her arm playfully and causing her to growl, though if he heard it, he pays it no mind.
	
	“I ain’t stupid. I know all about the supernatural world, you gotta protect yourself.” He flips his wrist over for me to see the small anti-possession tattoo there along with a few other symbols decorating his arm. I raise my brow.
	
	“A little excessive, don’t ya think?”

	“No such thing,” he shouts, shooting up to his feet, almost falling backward due to the quick motion.

“Like the back of my hand.” She nods with a small smile, inviting Jeff over as she questions the layout, the houses and if they had fences. By the time she’s done, we have a fantastic visual understanding of what we were about to walk into. Off of Jett’s intel, the street was a court, three houses resting on the loop. The first two houses that one had to pass when on the road held demons. Four houses down, demons in those houses as well. And then the three loop houses each held demons. Jeff estimated the demon count to be at least fifteen. The house in the middle was the one where Raum and Bradley were.

I was about to question how he knew that, but he answers me himself, describing the screams that originate from the house every hour.

I steal a glance at Sydero whose eyes begin to mix, her hand balled up into a fist.

“Let’s go, we’ll walk from here,” Sydero states, going around and grabbing her pack.

“Good luck with that. I’m not staying around for whatever is going to go down,” Jeff says, shooting us the peace sign before walking off, whistling a merry little beat as he went.

[[Continue-&gt;HH5_2]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1493" name="HH5_2" tags="" position="1500,6300" size="100,100">We walk down another street, staying close to the houses as we go along. After learning that the road we needed was infected with demons, we chose to take another route, the back way. As I go, I suddenly feel a small pinch in my head. I scratch my head, but immediately I’m brought to my knees, gritting through the pain as I tell myself not to scream out. It felt as if someone was banging a gong right near my brain, not ceasing for anything. That or some kind of wild animal who demanded freedom.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“Zillah!” I curse, falling back even more. I can hear Sydero and Chris, the worry in their tones. I can almost feel their hands on me, trying to figure out what was going on.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“Zillah!” I curse, falling back even more. I can hear Sydero, the worry in her tone. I can almost feel her touch, trying to figure out what was going on.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“It’s him,” I manage to say, “the spirit.”    

“If you think I’m letting you walk into that trap and get yourself killed, you’re crazy,” Zillah barks, increasing his attack on me. I whimper at the pain, thoughts of dying, a release from this pain, surfacing.

“This is for your own good,” he growls, “I will not fail.”

&lt;&lt;if $nerve &gt;= 50 or $entitytakeover is false&gt;&gt;\
	“You … do not … control me,” I growl, screaming the thought though mumbling it in reality. I feel a shockwave at my declaration, it felt cleansing, like the dawning of light on a new day. I shiver as I slowly get feeling in my body, my surroundings making sense again.
	
	&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
		“What happened?” I ask, searching my mind for Zillah’s presence but only feeling a faint marker that tells me he’s still there.

		“You’re asking us?” Chris asks, astonished. I roll my eyes, looking around.

		“Are you okay?” Sydero questions and I nod.

		“I think he’s going to be out for a while, we might want to hurry.” We turn and continue on.
	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
		“What happened?” I ask, searching my mind for Zillah’s presence but only feeling a faint marker that tells me he’s still there.

		“You’re asking me?” Sydero asks, “are you okay is the better question.”

		“I think he’s going to be out for a while, we might want to hurry.” We turn and continue on.
	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“I can’t,” I tell them, attempting to block him out, to push him out of my mind, but I only make it worse. Every second, the pain comes in another wave, rushing over me with incredible strength, and I begin to doubt my own strength. What if he won? If I wasn’t able to get up from this?

	“Stop … moving,” I hear Sydero say, and though I can’t make out every word she says, I feel the touch of something on my forehead. The pressure increases, and instead of one wave, I feel multiple. As if a full-scale war is going on in my head, both sides equal in their strengths and weaknesses. I scream, not able to keep it in no matter how much I try.

	“Bitch!” I hear Zillah shout before his voice suddenly disappears, and so does his presence. I can feel the second presence leaving me, leaving behind a desolate land that will heal soon but will take time. A slight ringing can still be heard, but at least I feel like me again.

	“Are you okay?” I hear Sydero growl lowly as I blink, taking the world in again. I look over at her, cursing lowly when I see that the crimson has fully claimed her eyes.

	“What did you do?”

	“Put him to sleep,” she informs, “for now anyway.”

	&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
		Chris helps me to my feet as we glance at her, “we’re on a time limit now.” I nod, and we quickly go back to walking, heading in our previous direction.
	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
		“I think we’re on a time limit now,” Sydero manages to say in between her deep breaths, none of them helping her to convert back. I agree with her word, and we go back to walking, our pace quickened.

	We stay to the shadows the best we can, but our main priority is avoiding windows. We stay close to walls and fences as we go, Sydero keeping her attention on the positions of the demons she could sense, while Chris and I kept our ears open and our eyes on anything that we needed to avoid.

&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

When we finally make it to the three houses on the loop, we look through the gaps in the wooden fences, seeing four demons talking among one another.

“Can they sense you?” I whisper to Sydero, who shakes her head.

“Concealing my presence is like second nature to me. Though, if I go full demonic, then it won’t matter.” I nod and look back at the group. They stand in front of the sliding doors of the house where who knows how many more demons are.
&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	
	“What should we do?” Chris asks.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“We have two options. We either stay to the shadows and try to sneak into the middle house, or we go ahead and try to take these demons out.”
&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	
	“Quietly, right?” Chris questions and Sydero nods.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“Let’s try to do this as quietly as possible. Sneak in, grab Bradley and get out,” I tell the two of them. Sydero nods and looks around for a better point of entry. Unsure of whether she found it or not, I watch as she picks up a decently sized rock, about to throw it when Chris stops her.

	“May I?”

	“Go for it, Slugger.” Chris narrows his eyes on the closest house and send the rock flying. It hits one of the windows and though it doesn’t break, the sound is loud enough to attract the attention of the demons in front of us.
&lt;&lt;else &gt;&gt;\
	“Let’s try to do this as quietly as possible. Sneak in, grab Bradley and get out,” I tell her. Sydero nods and looks around for a better point of entry. Unsure of whether she found it or not, I watch as she picks up a decently sized rock, throwing it at the house to the left of the one that we were at. It hits something, making a sound loud enough to attract the attention of the demons in front of us.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“The hell was that?” a new demon questions, opening up the window and peering down at the four, then over at the other house where the sound originated from.

“No idea, let’s go see.” They move towards it, and we hear more conversation the house over, right now was probably the best time to do this. As soon as they open the gate and head to the other house, we sprint inside.

&lt;&lt;if $perception &gt;=10&gt;&gt;\
	I lead the way, my senses picking up every little thing. From the creaking floorboards to the weight of something shifting on the floor above us.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	Sydero leads the way, stopping whenever she hears the slightest sound and causing me to bump into her numerous of times.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“Will your bowl work from here?” I question Sydero as we head into the kitchen, taking cover underneath a window that has a perfect view of the house that we needed to be in.

“No. As far as I know, the bowl has to be in the same house as the demons that you’re after.”

“Can you figure out where Raum is?” I inquire, and in response, Sydero closes her eyes. A few minutes later, she shivers and reopens her eyes.

&lt;&lt;if $langstonDead&gt;&gt;\
	“I sense three demons and a werewolf, but I can’t get an exact location on any of them. Petri seems farther away though, a demonic presence beside him. I can’t be sure, but I think they’re upstairs, whether that demonic presence is Raum or not, is the big question.” It was just going to have to be another risky situation.

	“Couldn’t this just be part of the trap? Raum knows we’re here and he leaves Bradley out in the open for us to rescue him?” Chris asks, neither of us answering him, though he was probably right. I was well past this being a trap, and if I thought anymore on the idea, then I would believe that everything we’ve done so far has been exactly what they wanted. We could scream out, ‘we’re here,’ and it&#39;ll probably be what they wanted.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“So, thoughts?”

“Continue with the stealth,” Sydero sighs, “when we get outside, we throw another rock to make it seem that we’re still in that area. Maybe confused about which house Bradley’s in, and we go get Bradley.”

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	I nod, and we do exactly that. After scoping out the surrounding area, Chris throws another rock and then we rush to the second house, slipping inside with none the wiser.

I weigh both options and find that the only one I really like is the one that involves us taking care of the demons right now. And if something terrible does happen soon, at least we won’t have to worry about some of them later.

“We take them out now. Make sure we don’t have to deal with them later.”

&lt;&lt;if $exorcism &gt;=5&gt;&gt;\
	“Agreed. Do you remember the exorcism?” I panic a bit, wondering if I could finish it but not knowing for sure. “Roe,” Sydero growls, and I nod, taking a deep breath in and going through the words.

	“Then do it, now,” Sydero tells me, and I shout the words, loud enough to affect the demons in front of me but not loud enough for those surrounding to hear. I go over the words, watching as their eyes widen as they freeze up, unable to move.
	
	&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
		“Why couldn’t you do that?” Chris asks Sydero as I finish up, happy that I hadn’t messed this up.

	“Demonic side,” Sydero sings, rolling her eyes as she beckons both of us forward and towards the house.
	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
        	Once I’m done, Sydero beckons me forward and into the house.
	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
		“I’m going to exorcise them,” Sydero states, only stopping when I place a hand on her arm.

	“Doesn’t that push your whole demonic side?”

	“Yea, but unless you have a better idea?” I close my mouth, and she nods, turning her attention back to the demons and doing as she said. They collapse to the ground before they even know what’s going on, smoke rising from the bodies and the land. With them taken care of, we dart into the house.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“How many demons are in here?” I ask her, and she shushes me, vanishing from beside me. I hear grunted shouts coming from upstairs, putting two and two together. I head towards the kitchen, waiting for her to finish up and join me.

“Will your bowl work from here?” I question, taking cover underneath a window that has a perfect view of the house that we needed to be in.

“No. As far as I know, the bowl has to be in the same house as the demons that you’re after.”

	“Alright, we all know what we have to do. Let’s get this done with as quickly as possible,” Sydero whispers to us, pulling out her bowl and immediately heading over to a barren corner to begin. I nod to Chris, giving him my luck as he hurries off to find Bradley.

	I check my gun and make sure my blade can be slipped out quickly as I stand by Sydero. She begins to say words from a different language, pouring ingredients into the bowl as she goes. I watch as each word that she says causes a word in the bowl to glow a bright cyan color. Every ingredient added morphs into a transparent form of liquid and begins to bubble.
	
	&lt;&lt;if $perception &gt;= 10&gt;&gt;\
		I hear the subtle sound of a foot hitting wood and use my peripheral vision to see a figure trying to sneak up on us. I wait a moment longer, before turning, brandishing my knife and scratching the demon on the cheek. It screams in agony before lunging towards me, attempting to choke me. I see another and quickly headbutt the one closest to me before grabbing my gun and shooting a single bullet at the second. 

		//Keep them away from Sydero//, I tell myself, repeating the words as I fight. 
	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
		Suddenly, I feel hands clasp around my neck, dragging me backward and away from Sydero’s vulnerable side. I fight, all I can as I fall to the ground, clenching my teeth as a figure gets on top of me and begins to mercilessly punch me.

		//Get up//, I scream at myself, repeating the words as I fight. I headbutt the demon on top of me, spotting another almost at Sydero’s side. I grab my gun and shoot before having to put my attention back on the other.
	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

	“I’m so happy you two could join us today,” I hear Raum say as I dodge the punches of the demon closest to me. Where were Chris and Bradley?

	“Alright, we both know what we have to do. Let’s get this done with as quickly as possible,” Sydero whispers to me, pulling out her bowl and immediately heading over to a barren corner to begin. I take a shaky deep breath in and then head off to find Bradley.

	I tread carefully through the dark house, finding that though this was perhaps someone’s real home, it was one of the creepiest houses I’ve ever been in. Perhaps it was knowing that demons and other supernatural creatures resided nearby. As I pass pictures of smiling family members, I feel them staring back at me, questioning my purpose and why I had dared entered their home. I wonder if the demons had just possessed the family’s body. It made far more sense than just kicking the family our, or even killing them.
	
	&lt;&lt;if $nerve &lt; 50&gt;&gt;\
		I head down the hallway and go to the first door, pressing my ear up against it and hearing nothing. Cautiously, I open it, my heart freaking out as I picture a group of demons in the room.

Bradley opens his eyes to find himself roped to a chair; his body aching, and his mind lolling from one side to the other. The room that he was currently in was dark, only one window allowing light to come in and telling him that daylight was just beginning to break. He whimpers in pain as he moves his wrist. The taste of blood was on his tongue and seeing that he could hardly open one eye, he knew what his current state was. He was lucky to even be breathing right now.

Raum was more than serious with his threat. Each hour that passed was filled with him being visited by one of the many demons that fell under Raum’s command. They did enough to make him question his life and regret every waking moment. He thought himself strong, stronger than most boys his age who worried more about defying their parents and getting laid than running from werewolves and demons. He thought himself even stronger than some of the hunters he knew. But that was also him and wishful thinking. He was no stronger than the average kid.

The door to the room opens, and his entire body grew stiff as he heard the distant sound of the alarm, warning him that another hour was up. He whimpers, tears flowing down his face as another new face approaches him. He wanted to beg, to plead for them to have mercy. That for at least this hour, to ask them not to do anything. But that would fall on deaf ears and make this all the much worse.

	I needed to get out of that motel, it was giving me a headache and every second that ticked by reminded me that we were no closer to saving Bradley. Sydero had gotten back from wherever she had gone and was doing countless spells to find him, as well as calling people who I suppose owed her. Chris had asked for the keys to my car to go scout out the surrounding area. Seeing that he was the only one that could get by without being detected, I didn’t mind.

[[Continue-&gt;HH2_1]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1499" name="HH2_1" tags="" position="426,6300" size="100,100">I was currently walking down the street and heading towards the nearby store, at the same time trying to get ahold of the Entity. I nudge whatever relationship line the Entity and I shared, and I hear them shift in my mind, growling a warning.

“You will stop calling me as if you’re in charge here,” they warn, and I ignore them. They seem to always forget that they&#39;re the parasite in //my// mind.
&lt;&lt;if $entityBet&gt;&gt;\
	
	“Unless you forgot, you lost that bet we made,” I remind them, silence follows.

	“I doubt now is a good time to inform you of everything that’s going on,” they point out. I focus back in, barely avoiding a lamppost that was resting in front of me. “Point proven.”

	“Don’t worry about that, just tell me what you know.”

	“Later,” they yawn, and I mentally roar, catching their attention, “well, $name. If you can roar like that, I wonder how you purr.”

	I ignore them, something that I was getting good at, “we had a deal.”

	“Watch yourself, pet. I’ll honor that deal, just as soon as you’re not wandering streets you don’t know.”

	“Yea, and when I’m safe and sound, you’ll just find another excuse, right?”

	“Perhaps. Or maybe I’ll shock you and give you what you want, just for the fun of it,” they chuckle.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

The fog begins to disappear from my mind before freezing, and I glance to see that the Entity has stopped, lips pursed as they glare at me through large white amused eyes.

“Let’s get this out of the way then. You can continue calling me that stupid little name of yours, but out of all the centuries I have existed, my maker has called me Zillah. And you can stop talking to me as if I’m a they when I’m a he. But nice job with the whole, ‘not assuming one’s gender,’ real stellar work there.”

“So you actually have a name?”

“No,” he laughs and rolls his eyes as he begins to disappear, “I was just created to be called silly things by silly little creatures such as yourself.” He rolls his eyes, and before I can ask anything else, he and the fog disappear, leaving me with the words, “watch out.”

I tune back into my surroundings, narrowly avoiding face planting into a sign for the grocery store. I search my mind again but find that The Entity … Zillah is gone. Zillah, it was a start, I suppose.

I enter the grocery store, realizing that this was the first public place I’ve been in since my public death. For some reason, I didn’t expect to be in the same town that I died in when I made my debut. I grab one of the recyclable bags they have and go around the store, aimlessly putting food and snacks into it. I grab loads of salt and water bottles. As I head towards the self-checkout, my eyes land on the cereal brand that Bradley loves. I stop, memories flooding my senses of the young boy and that goofy laugh of his. His constant jokes and untouchable attitude.

We need to get him back.

I buy the groceries and head back when I feel something pounding in my head. I tighten my grip on the bags as I slump over on the store’s brick wall in agony, trying to stay on my feet but feeling like I was failing. I suddenly feel like I’m falling.

“Unless you’re going back to get your car, that’s the wrong way out of town,” Zillah tells me, appearing in front of me, floating while I’m falling.

“Stop this,” I growl, but he does nothing, only glaring at me with those two empty white spots for eyes.

“You first, leave town.”

“For what?”

“This foolishness will get you killed. Join that stupid group later, but don’t head into it.” I reach out towards him, attempting to either claw him or grab him. I do neither, and then I stop. I can breathe, my mind clears, and Zillah is gone. After we grab Bradley, he’ll be next on my list.

	I return to the motel to find that my car sits in the parking lot and Chris and Sydero inside. Chris sits patiently on the small circular table, watching Sydero pace back and forth, mumbling something incoherent.

	“What’s going on?” I ask, putting the bag on the spare bed, Sydero turning on her heel and looking at me with a satisfied smile.

	“She got something. So do I,” Chris informs me. His eyes are dark, but there’s a trace of a smile on his features as well. I take a seat on the bed.
	
	&lt;&lt;if $langstonDead&gt;&gt;\
		“It was pure luck, really. But I spotted Petri walking out of a gas station with some food. I followed him to a neighborhood but kinda had to stop for some kids playing. I have the name of the neighborhood, but I don’t know what street he went down.”

	“Still, that’s more than what we had before,” I tell him and nod, gazing over at Sydero who now sits in a chair.

	“I called Faye, and we did some searching, there’s a new moon tomorrow.”

	“Meaning what exactly?”

	“We know Raum wants me, but that was it, which made this trap even more dangerous. During a new moon, a demon can open up a portal to hell.”

	“So, Raum wants to drag you off to hell?”

	“If my idea of who he’s working for is true, then yes.”

	“Mind sharing that with the class?” I question.

	“My father –”

	“I swear. If you say Lucifer I’m going to scream like a little child and hightail my ass back to Virginia and act like you guys don’t exist,” Chris states, glaring at Sydero who glares right back.

	“Lucifer.” The two continue to stare at one another, Chris’s eye twitching as Sydero just smirks. “But no. My father is Lust.”

	“Lust? Like, a demon who practices lust or … or do you mean the actual sin?”

	“Bingo. The seven deadly sins to you all, the Seven Princes of Hell to us. My father is Lust.”

	“So … your uncles would be the other sins?” Chris asks, mouth open. Sydero nods.

	“Which is how I’m a Lust Cambion. But who he’s working for isn’t the point. Only demons can go through those portals, anything else that steps foot near it gets burned by Hell’s Fire.”

	“So, we know what he’s going to do and when. But we still don’t know what we can do to counter it,” I point out after thinking the information through.

	“Maybe we do,” Sydero picks up her Babylonian bowl, “the bowl can bind demons. If I can set it up in the house that Raum is in, I can trap him and kill him. I’m way more in tune with my demon side, it can be done.”

	“Why do I feel a ‘but’ coming on somewhere though?” Chris inquires.

	“But Raum isn’t stupid, he knew about the bowl. And one thing about the bowl is that I can’t use it when I’m in my demon form.”

	“Then don’t shift until after.”

	I’m quiet as Raum’s plan begins to unfold in front of me, why he stole Bradley and not Chris or I, why he did it when he did it. “You take one look at Bradley though, and you’re liable to go demonic.”

	“Exactly.”

	“Could we just do all this in the morning? Before Raum can trigger the portal?”

	“For me to be able to kill him using the spell with the bowl, I need the new moon as well.”

	“So, let me get this straight. Raum is going to open up a portal during the new moon, to drag you back to hell. He expects us to show up and for you not to be able to use the bowl because of Bradley and whatever he did to him. Leaving us defenseless?” It was Chris’s turn to pace, and I watch as my college friend goes back and forth, his eyes stuck on the floor right in front of him.

	“What if, as soon as we get into the house, you go straight to setting up the bowl. While $name and I go get Bradley?”

	“I’ll have to be focused; demons might come after me.”

	“Then I’ll go get Bradley, and $name will stay with you. The biggest thing here is that we need that bowl in place and Bradley with us. So less about luck and more about speed.” I look over at Sydero who&#39;s thinking Chris’s words over as well. Finally, she nods.

	“Let’s start preparing for tomorrow then.”
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	I return to the motel to find Sydero pacing back and forth inside, mumbling something incoherent.

	“What’s going on?” I ask, putting the bag on the spare bed, Sydero turning on her heel and looking at me with a satisfied smile.

	“I got something,” she informs me. I take a seat on the bed, ready to hear it.

	“I called Faye, and she was able to locate Bradley’s general position. It’s in a neighborhood that she gave me the name for. We can look at the layout and all that later. But we also did some searching, there’s a new moon tomorrow.”

	“Meaning what exactly?”

	“We know Raum wants me, but that was it, which made this trap even more dangerous. During a new moon, a demon can open up a portal to hell.”

	“So, Raum wants to drag you off to hell?”

	“Mind sharing that with the class?”

	“My father, or maybe one of my uncles.”

	“I swear. If you say Lucifer is your father I’m going to quit,” I tell her, and she rolls her eyes in annoyance.

	“If you think Lucifer would ever bed a human then you’re nuts. No, my father is Lust.”

	“Lust? Like, a demon who practices lust or … or do you mean the actual sin?”

	“Bingo. The seven deadly sins to you all, the Seven Princes of Hell to us.”

	“So … your uncles would be the other sins?” Sydero nods.

	“I’ll have to be focused; demons might come after me.”

	“Then this all revolves around how fast we can be. Otherwise, I don’t have anything helpful.” Sydero thinks over my words quietly, nodding soon after.

	“Let’s start preparing for tomorrow then.”
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

Preparing is a mix of us talking through the plan, trying to erase any holes that we might find and make sure that we were all to be efficient. We look over the layout of the neighborhood, finding that there were four streets that they could be on. But once Sydero was close enough, she should be able to pick up on their presence. We [[bless the water]] and [[pour salt]] into anything that could hold it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1501" name="bless the water" tags="" position="452,6403" size="100,100">I steady the water bottle in my lap as I pour in the blessed water, removing the rosary beads, my eye-catching sight of the cross that dangles from it. I find myself staring at it for quite some time, my brain working through questions that I know it will never find answers to. I only come out of it when I feel someone sit beside me, looking to see Sydero with a bottle that she wishes to fill.

“So, is God real?” I ask, not really thinking about my question.

“What?”

“God? I mean, if Lucifer is real because demons and all that are, does that mean God is too?”

I look over to see Sydero shrug before saying, “I always just presumed he was real since everything else. Why not?” I get quiet, the obvious questions of ‘why’ and ‘if so’ running through my mind. “Hey, don’t do that to yourself,” she says, standing and looking down at me with narrowed eyes. “Don’t do the whole, ‘so where is God’ thing. Wiser people than you have asked and have come up blank.”

“So what’re your thoughts?”

“I’m half-demon, I don’t really think my thoughts on the matter count.”

“But you’re also half human.”

She sighs and turns to face me, pursing her lips, “I really don’t know, Roe. I try not to think of questions like this for the sole reason of never finding an answer. I could say they’re just enjoying a mojito as they watch us squirm. Or, I could say they’re just busy. Honestly, I think they’re just bigger than this. You suddenly turning religious on me?”
 
[[“I’ve always been religious.”]]
[[“No, just trying to wrap my mind around things.”]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1502" name="pour salt" tags="" position="557,6403" size="100,100">I pour salt into small vial-like cartridges, also adding some of them to the bullet rounds that Sydero had given me. My head was still pounding, and though he wasn’t as strong as he was earlier, I can still hear Zillah whispering his warnings to me.

“Hey, Sydero,” I shout, grabbing her attention. She was cleaning her gun at the moment.

“Are there any spells to dispelling spirits out of the body?”

“Tons of them, you’re referring to that spirit inside you?”

“Yea. Can you really not sense it?”

She shakes her head, “which isn’t weird. A powerful spirit that has connections to its host can actually skirt under any kind of radar, even a pure werewolf’s. But,” she continues, “separating a spirit from a host like that can be more than just dangerous. Depending on tons of factors, it’s like ripping out an organ and then patting you on the head instead of trying to repair the damage. And afterward, the host goes through major withdrawal.”

“So there’s no safe way?”

“Eh, like I said, depending on the witch who does it.”

“Could you?” She gives me a look and nods.

“We’ll discuss this further once we have Bradley.” I thank her silently before going back to my work, she does the same.

I don’t know, I guess fighting demons in your everyday life and hearing that Lucifer is a thing just kinda, warps your thoughts. Like, how true are all these religious texts?”

“There’s truth in all of them. I’ve met Pagan gods, ran from Hindu spirits, screamed in terror at Asian spirits – let me tell you, Asian spirits take the cake. Don’t get me started on the Kekkai and Oshiroibaba.” I roll my eyes as she goes about her business.

&lt;&lt;if $cp&gt;&gt;\
	“If it makes you feel any better,” Chris begins, coming over to my side and taking the almost empty water gallon, “I’ve been thinking the same thing.”

	“It’s … weird, right?” I ask, and he nods.

	“I was raised in a Christian household. My parents couldn’t stop talking about God and Jesus but … here I am calling a cambion an ally and fighting demons. I just can’t help but think, what if we find an angel? Like, this crap boggles my mind.” I nod, sighing as I go back to work.

“I suppose he is,” Sydero answers me, “I’ve never seen him but the way my uncles and father talk about him, he’s … something.” Her face seems to grow dark, and I decide to continue my rambling.

“Well, then that means angels are real.”

“They’re definitely real. And definitely annoying. Grade A assholes, would rather be stuck with demons.”

“That’s only because you are one,” I point out, and she snorts.

“I hate everything, so that’s not it.”

“You’re one of those, I prefer the dead over the living, aren’t you?”

“I actually prefer the living over the dead, believe it or not, they speak less,” she throws a smirk my way before getting to her feet, continuing her task as I get back to mine.

Rarely did anything ever work the way we needed it to. I beg that our luck would change.

	I make my way back towards the motel room, freezing at the door. Chris is sitting on a bench with a soda in his hands, staring out at the flat landscape. I peek into the motel room and see Sydero hunched over a bag, grumbling something to herself.

	I approach Chris, “this seat taken?”

	“Naw, I’m just trying to find something normal to grasp onto.”

	“What do you mean?”

	“Well, in a day, we’re going to be fighting a shitload of demons and trying to save Bradley from who knows what. Like, what do you think they did to him? I mean, I keep thinking that the threat was empty, they know if they do something to Bradley and we find out, then their whole plan is done with. But this isn’t some movie. Raum doesn’t exactly strike me as someone who’ll go easy just because Bradley’s a kid.”

	“How is that grasping onto something normal?” I laugh, and he chuckles in response, looking at me. He searches my face, and I can’t tell what he’s searching for. Whatever it is, he doesn’t seem to find it. It takes me a few more minutes to realize what probably was going through his mind.

	“Is this about …”

	“Don’t say their names, please,” Chris sighs, taking a long sip of his soda. “Nothing is normal for me anymore. I either think about //that// stuff, or I’m pulled right back into thinking about you and …” He turns to me. “I know we already talked about this and, I really do want to move on. But … I still have trouble trusting you. And I guess it’s even weirder for me because I’m not used to talking about it. I don’t like bringing up this emotional bullshit, but what else can I do? Say I’m not bothered and let it fester and end up hating you?”

	I sit quietly, biting the inside of my cheek as I listen to him.

	“Anyway, I shouldn’t even be thinking about any of this. I need a clear head … for Bradley.” I want to argue, to say that this conversation wasn’t exactly over, but he gets up before I can say anything more. He sends me a small smile before throwing his soda can away and going back inside.

		I approach Chris, stopping when I hear him humming a song and even mumbling a few of the words to himself. He taps his foot and shimmies in his spot, letting the imaginary music take over. I watch as he mocks placing the guitar and can’t help but laugh, raising my hands apologetically when he jumps and sees me.
		
		“Is this like catching your friend dancing alone in their room?”
		
		“I caught you doing that so many times, but I just walked away and let you have it.”
		
		“When was this?” I ask, terror in my eyes, he sees this and laughs, throwing a casual arm over my shoulder as he laughs.

		I feel him shift closer, nuzzling into my neck as I move some of his hair from tickling my cheek. He nips playfully at my neck, and I snort in laughter before moving him away.

		“Are you scared?” I ask.

		“Not for me … for you, really.”

		“I’m not the one who was kidnapped,” I point out, and he shakes his head.

		“That’s not the reason. $name … you have a thing for throwing yourself into the middle of things. And, I’m not saying that’s a bad thing, but it also doesn’t make me sit here and think you won’t get caught up in something.”

		“Well, I’ll have you to watch my back.”

		“Totally, cause you’re not stronger than me or anything,” he says sarcastically, wrapping his arms around me.

		“Please promise you’ll be careful,” he murmurs.

		“I will, Chris.” He sits up, softly cupping my face, and looking me in the eyes.

		“I’m not playing, $name. If I lose you, I’ll …” he trails off, his eyes meeting the pavement as terror spreads across his face.

		“Hey, Chris,” I start, encouraging him to meet my gaze again.

		“You’re not gonna lose me. I promise.” He softly presses his lips towards mine, as if sealing my words off with a kiss. The more the seconds tick by, the deeper the kiss becomes. It shifts from only representing a promise to one of need and fear. The two intermingling, pressing up against one another until there were no boundaries.

		I pull back, breathless, knowing that I wanted more but also knowing that it wasn’t the time.

		“When we get Bradley back, I’m going to want another one of those,” he whispers, stealing little pecks. I smile and nod.

		“When was this?” I ask, terror in my eyes, he sees this and laughs, throwing a casual arm over my shoulder as he laughs. I move into his hold a bit more, both of us realizing what was happening at the same time. I move to give him more space when I realize that his grasp is still on me. My eyes widen, going from his arm to his face, realizing that he had been looking at me. Suddenly, he blushes deeply and releases me.

		“Sorry, I just zoned out just then.”

		“It’s fine. Happens to all of us,” I say, a professional now at masking my disappointment. Why did I continue to do this to myself? To yearn for his presence and his touch when I know it won’t end well.

		We sit quietly, the awkward air between us, causing me to want to rise and go back into the motel. I felt sick, going after a straight guy, knowing how wrong it was.

		“Hey,” I look over at Chris who was smiling softly, brow raised, “penny for those thoughts of yours.” He taps my forehead playfully, and I swat his hand away with a chuckle.

		“It’s nothing.”

		“Is it about us?” My eyes widen, and I look over at him, causing him to blush yet again. “I didn’t mean to be presumptuous or anything. It’s just … that’s what’s been on my mind, and I was hoping I wasn’t the only one.”

		“Wait, what? You … think about us?” My heart soars, and I mentally tell it to calm itself. Knowing Chris, he meant it in a friendly way. But what friends say that? Do friends say that? They say things like that, right? Should I ask Sydero, though I doubt she’s ever had a friend.

		“Yea … a lot now,” he takes a deep breath in and turns to me. “I really don’t know how to say it. But I think I have feelings for you. I think, I don’t know. This is so hard and messed up.”

		I raise a brow, “messed up?”

		“No, not like that. I just,” he covers his face, shaking his head and then gently laying it back so that he could stare up at the sky. “I can’t stop thinking about you, and me, together. Part of me is saying that it’s because we’re friends. Or something else, I don’t know. Every time I think I like you I hear my dad’s voice, telling me that I’m wrong or confused and that I don’t like you. That he didn’t raise a gay guy.” I can see him starting to shake and rest my hand over his.

		“There’s nothing wrong with being a gay guy, though you wouldn’t be gay, technically. Pansexual, really.”

		“My dad doesn’t care what you call it.”

		“You’re not your dad.”

		He nods, “I know that, and you know that. But … I don’t believe that. I don’t know, $name. I still need to think about this, but I didn’t think it was fair to leave you in the dark.”

		“I’m here for you. Coming out isn’t always an easy thing, but I can say without a doubt that you’re surrounded by people who wouldn’t care.” He looks at me, fighting a smile before nodding and moving away from my touch.

		“I’ll see you later … I’m going to take a walk.” I nod, not stopping him, though I wanted to. He needed this, and my presence might only suffocate him.

	I approach Sydero, giving her a small smile that doesn’t last when she looks up at me. With my faded smile, Sydero looks away, sighing wistfully.

	“You’re going to ask me again? About Doran, I mean?” I nod, though realizing that she can’t see me. I’m about to say more when I see her turn to face me again, sitting with her back up against the wall.

	“Nothing happened. I persuaded him by promising him greater power,” she rolls her eyes, “he was all for that.”

	“Then why not just tell me that? Why walk around letting me believe something else? Knowing that it was eating me up?”

	She shrugs, refusing to meet my eye now, “honestly? You gave me the perfect ammunition to make you hate me. It was so perfect,” she chuckles, “you know how I feel about sex and Doran did interest me. Letting you believe that we actually had sex was a sure-fire way to piss you off.”

	“You want me to hate you then?”

	“Yes,” she says matter-of-factly, “in the beginning, this was a game. Either you were supposed to leave, or quit, or just realize how stupid you pursuing me was. But … here we are.” She relaxes her head on the wall before meeting my gaze. “I’ll say that I’m sorry about not telling you, but I’m not going to apologize for trying to make you hate me. This, us, will not end the way you think it will.”

	“Us? So, you thought about it?”

	“You’re impossible,” she growls, pushing herself to her feet and standing in front of me. Neither of us looks away, both of us trying to find something that probably wasn’t there.

	“Yea,” she finally says, and I raise a confused brow. “Us. I’ve thought about it. I’ve thought about how we’ll end up crashing and burning as well. And I rather you hate me now, than then.”

	My next action was done carefully, my brain not totally realizing what I was doing until I was doing it. I place a light hand on Sydero’s face, causing her to jump and stiffen under my touch.

	“Or how about I just not hate you at all?”

	“That’s not an option.”

	“Is it not? Is it really that weird for someone to like you because they just do?” She takes a step back, narrowing her eyes as if I was someone who couldn’t be trusted.

	“Yes. Whatever you like, Roe. It’s not real, you don’t know me. You just found out what I really am. There’s a whole past that you have no idea about.”

	I take another step towards her, “then tell me. And let me figure that out for myself.” She seems to think my words over before shrugging.

	“Later, when we get back from this hell show. I want to focus on Bradley, not … us.” I nod, smirking at her use of the word ‘us.’ She notices it and rolls her eyes, stating that she’s going to go for a walk before leaving the room.

		I approach Sydero, giving her a small smile that doesn’t last when she looks up at me. Though my smile has faded, Sydero’s gaze stays rested on me, her eyes trying to figure out an incomprehensible puzzle.

		“You should have walked away when you had the chance,” she begins, shaking her head forlornly before rubbing her eyes and massaging her temple.

		“Where’s the fun in that?” I snicker.

		“I’m serious, Roe,” she growls, tossing me a look that matched her tone.

		“Does it matter? I’m here, I think you’re just going to have to get over that.” Sydero gets up, pacing back and forth, suddenly she stops and punches the motel wall, creating a fist-sized hole in the drywall. I stiffen at that, all traces of me joking suddenly disappearing.

		“You’re not supposed to be here,” she hisses, turning her head away from me. I see her shivering, and my only guess is that it’s due to the anger coursing through her. “If we had never met, it would have saved us both some grief.” She straightens up and manages an ingenuine smile, the smile conveying the exact opposite of the emotion in her eyes, sadness, and pain.

		“Sydero? Where is this coming from?” Sydero now suddenly stands before me, gazing into my eyes. I’m frozen in confusion and lust, my own emotions causing me insurmountable turmoil. She rests a gentle hand on the side of my face, and I lean into her touch, not realizing how much I was craving it.

		“What we’re about to do is so much more than dangerous. And I won’t be able to live with myself if something happens to you,” she tells me. I can hear her heart breaking in her voice, her defenses crashing down as the reality of our situation makes itself well-known.

		“Then let’s make sure we both make it out of there, so we can discuss this later.” She straightens up, removing her hand and leaving my face cold and bare.

		“You’re right,” she says and then smirks, her eyes drifting up and down my body, “I would hate to see something happen to you before I truly had the time to admire you.” I roll my eyes at her statement but smile, a feeling that felt almost weird now. However small and insignificant in the grand scheme of things, I had hope now, something to look forward to.
	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\

I’m frozen in confusion and lust, my own emotions causing me insurmountable turmoil, or was that also because of her and her abilities? I feel myself leaning forward, wishing to capture her lips with mine when I feel her push me back roughly. My back hits the wall with a thud, but before I can even register the slight bit of pain that shoots up my back, she’s standing over me. Her body inches from mine, igniting every part of me. I long to wrap my arms around her and bring her up against me, to keep her there as we devour one another. But she pulls away.

		“Shit,” she groans, shaking her head irritably, looking me up and down, “I’d give anything to know what it is about you that lures me in like this.” 

		“It’s just my charming disposition,” I chuckle, and she joins in, her smile light.

		She places her hand on my chin, her breath ghosting across my lips, “if something happens to you when we’re out there ... I ... I don’t know what I’d do.” 
	
		“Sydero?” I question, but she still refuses to meet my gaze fully.

		“I’m not going to act like I don’t have ... feelings for you, Roe. That’s a waste of both of our times. But, I don’t know what to do with that either. It doesn’t matter how either of us feels, this won’t work.”

		“How would you know?”

		“I know,” she growls, she’s about to say more when she sighs and shakes her head, “I think this is a discussion that we should continue at a later time, agreed?” I nod, that familiar, intoxicating feeling coming over me again. She steps back, and the sensation disappears with her as she leaves.

	“Chris? Sydero?” I get no answer and check my phone, finding a message from Chris saying that they were up on the roof if I needed anything. I put on some warmer clothes and join them, finding some stairs to the side that lead up to it. I find them off to the side, Chris sitting up and eating sunflower seeds while Sydero just stares up at the star-speckled sky. I look towards the moon, hardly being able to see it.

	“No, I refuse to sit here and listen to this. How dare you think The Beatles are better than Queen.”

	“They dominated the charts, Chris. They have way more well-known songs, and you tell me, who has the better musicians?”

	“Don’t you dare bring that up. Freddie Mercury is a god.”

	“Wow, one guy compared to John Lennon, George, and Paul? Come on now.”

	“Never suspected you to be a classic rock fan,” I point out, causing Chris to jump at the sound of my voice, though I suppose Sydero sensed me there. “I’m no Chris, but I know the greats.”

	“She knows the greats, but she says that Queen is second place to the Beatles.”

	“Queen’s music was so much better. The Beatles were impactful, yea, but music wise the Queen’s win. And that’s what we’re talking about, not their impact.”

	“Queen’s music is good, but the Beatles have far more hits.”

	“You okay?” I ask, walking over to her and sitting down softly.

	“Just … preparing.”

	“Yea, I guess I should’ve figured that out.” I gaze over at her and see her glaring at the moon, her eyes pleading.

	“You’re thinking of Bradley?”

	“Yea … I just. What happens if we go in there and find out Bradley’s dead? What if we do one wrong thing and Bradley ends up dead because of it. I …”

	“You don’t have to say it Sydero, I’ve been thinking it too.” She looks over at me and nods in understanding. It all comes down to tomorrow then, the new moon.

“So, no one can sleep, huh?” They’re both quiet, never answering me as we all stare up at the sky. Lost in our own thoughts, in our own world. Hoping that Bradley was okay.

[[Act Two-&gt;EP11-Act Two]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1513" name="HH6_1" tags="" position="1820,6304" size="100,100">I look towards Sydero, seeing the sweat that rolls down her face as she tries to focus, clenching her eyes closed as she continued to say each word.

“You can stop now, Sydero,” Raum taunts, “or should we go ahead and kill the boy?”

“Ignore him, Sydero,” I shout, shooting some more demons. They seem to be coming from everywhere, the door open, an invitation to any and all.

“Hmm, his screams. He had such a spirit on him too. I’ll even admit that the boy had a strong spirit. Every hour we visited him,” Raum sends a smile my way as two demons grabbed me, “we broke him.”

Three words. Three measly words are all it took for a half-decent plan to vanish into thin air. I knew it before anyone else did, save for Raum who had anticipated this. I’m sure the only way he would’ve been shocked is if we hadn’t come at all and had forsaken Bradley to whatever fate had planned for him.

I watch as the bowl’s glowing words begin to fade, and Sydero turns around, her eyes a deep shade of crimson. She grabs one demon by the throat, and she threw them across the room. The one on top of me, she sends flying.

“Hmm, still not the Sydero that I know, but you can’t use that bowl of yours now,” Raum sighs and then smirks, “I know magic too.”
	
&lt;&lt;if $ls&gt;&gt;\
	He shouts out a few words, sending demons to slow down Sydero while she was on her warpath. He grabs one demon and slits its neck, pushing it to the middle of the room. I smirk, once he realizes that he had a lack of demons at his side, and Sydero was getting closer.

	“Langston, Petri, to me.” I watch as Petri shoots out from the hallway that Chris had gone down, barreling into Sydero and occupying her time while Langston goes to Raum.

	[[Go to Langston.]]
	[[Go to Petri.]]
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	He shouts out a few words, sending demons to slow down Sydero while she was on her warpath. He grabs one demon and slits its neck, pushing it to the middle of the room, and then another. Whatever this meant, causes Sydero to freeze, eyeing Raum as he sneers and goes up to a symbol on the wall, slapping his hand against it.

	A light suddenly explodes, and the sounds of moans and groans follow it. I shield my eyes, feeling flames lick my skin, and instinctually I jump back. I gaze towards the monstrous hole in the middle of the floor. The edges are burning with a fire that feels like it exists right beside me. It lurches back and forth, snapping at any who dare to come close. I stand on my toes to peer deeper inside but see nothing but black, a black that clings to my soul and tries to swallow it. Staring into it, I see thousands of eyes glare back, whispering for me to come closer, to take the plunge.

	“Don’t go near it,” I hear Sydero growl in rage, “it’ll kill you immediately.” Before I can question her, she shoots towards Raum’s figure, deftly sprinting around the edge of the hole to get to him, the two collide.

I freeze, my body shaking as I watch Langston scream out in pain and then fall to the ground, gripping his throat.

“What have you done?” Petri asks, frozen in place, shaking as he stares at his fallen friend.

“I needed blood, and now I have it.” He sneers, going to a symbol on the wall and placing his hand on it. A light suddenly explodes, and the sounds of moans and groans follow it.

I look for Petri, no longer seeing him in the room. I suppose he ran off as soon as Raum killed Langston. The future was uncertain, but I doubt I would see him again during this fight.

I get to my feet, only to be brought right back down by two demons that were somehow still kicking. I punch one, but the second grabs my wrist and holds me down as the other hits me repeatedly.

“$name!” I hear someone shout, and see Chris’s figure come into view, but then leaves a second later with the demon punching me with him. I turn on my heel, slashing the demon closest to me, plunging my blade into his heart before helping Chris.

	Suddenly, I’m blindsided by a quick figure and end up on the ground as the figure presses what feels like their knee into my side.

	“I’m going to kill you, fuck what anyone else says,” Petri growls. He hated me, his only hang up was if he wanted to kill me slowly or do it fast. And even with him on top of me, digging his nails into my chest and applying additional pressure to my arm, I can’t find myself to be very sympathetic. I killed Langston before he could kill me, in the game of survival, survival deemed him the loser, that was something I would think Petri would understand, even if he wasn’t happy about it.

	I open my mouth to say something, and he applies more pressure. I don’t know for sure if he was or not, but it felt like he was touching my heart, his nails teasingly scraping at it.

	I feel for my blade and quickly grab it and swipe it across his face, giving him a nasty scar. Before I can do more, he grabs my arm and brings his elbow down onto mine. I howl in pain as I hear the snap, my heart skipping a beat as my arm falls at my side.

	“$name!” I hear someone shout, and a figure suddenly hits Petri. I look over and see Chris and Petri wrestling, Petri more concerned with getting back to me than fighting off Chris. I whimper, finding that the more I move my broken arm, the more the pain escalates. I suddenly felt dizzy, the world blurring before fixing itself.

	I’m blindsided by a quick figure and end up on the ground as the figure presses what feels like their knee, into my side.

	“Nice to see you again, $name,” Langston laughs, showing me that he had my knife. Before I can lunge forward, I feel someone grab my shirt and send me flying into a wall. Afterward, I hear Petri’s low chuckle.

	“I’m coming, $name,” I hear Chris’s distant voice shout. This was madness, all of it. I didn’t know who was alive, who was fighting who, where Bradley was.

	“Get Bradley,” I moan, “we need to go.” I rise to my feet just as Langston is upon me again. I narrowly avoid being cut with my own blade. The stairs were to my left side, a wall to my right, and an endless hallway behind me. I dodge another swipe and then kick him in the groin, managing to run past him before he grabs my leg and chokes me.

	“Let’s hear you beg for death,” he growls.

[[Continue-&gt;HH8]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1517" name="HH7_1" tags="" position="2035,6304" size="100,100">Bradley sits in the middle of the room, tied to a chair, his head dangling. I rush to him, fighting the need to scream and vomit, all at once. Blood coats his entire upper half, bruises and cuts existing everywhere from his neck to his arms to his face. Both eyes were swollen, one completely purple and red and closed, while the other was only halfway there, but still just as bad. His nose looked broken, and blood streamed freely from cuts on his lips and brow. I glance down to find that I was standing in a puddle of his own blood.

“Damn it,” I growl as I touch him lightly. He immediately begins shaking, as if having a nightmare. “Hey, calm down, Bradley, it’s me, $name. I’m so sorry,” I whisper, cupping his face in my hands and gently raising it, hoping he could see me. I cut his restraints, and he weakly throws himself onto me. He cries into my shirt, his screams muffled as he pushes himself deeper into me.

“Every hour,” he cries, his grip tightening on me. My blood runs cold, so Raum wasn’t just bluffing, he literally beat him every hour. Bradley had been enduring this for that long? I stare into the distance as Bradley cries, only stopping to draw breath. I was frozen in my spot, forgetting where we were and the direness of our situation. Until I heard a floorboard creak.

I turn around just as the door closes. I move Bradley off of me and run to it, pounding on it repeatedly but to no avail. We were stuck in here … and Sydero was out there.

“Sydero!” I scream as loud as possible, hoping that she had already set up the bowl. I hear nothing but shouting and things hitting the wall on the other side.

[[Go to the window.]]
[[Try to break the door down.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1518" name="Go to the window." tags="" position="2035,6406" size="100,100">“Bradley, let’s go out the window,” I tell him, helping him to his feet and walking us over.

“Bad,” he tells me weakly, “stuck.”

“Huh? The window is stuck?”

“I tried to escape,” he manages to say, “bad.”

“Come on, stay with me, Bradley. We’re gonna get you outta here.” I carefully lower him to the ground and try the window, opening it and then kicking it numerous of times, nothing works. We were indeed stuck.

I rack my mind about how we could get out of here when I hear something that sounds far too similar to an explosion go off. The house rocks and I stiffen as I listen to what sounds like something being torn down. I go to Bradley’s side, cautiously pulling him over to the door, just as the wall closest to us comes down and two figures fly in.

Dark grey and red smoke surrounds Sydero as she brings her fist down onto Raum’s face repeatedly. I watch, at the last minute, he grabs her fist and headbutts her hard, his free hand clenched around her throat before throwing her off.

He gets to his feet and looks over at me.

&lt;&lt;if $langstonDead&gt;&gt;\
	“Petri, I found your chew toy,” he smirks before leaving.

	“Shit,” I growl, moving Bradley away from me as I get to my feet, grabbing my gun. I cautiously walk forward, peeking around the hole in the wall when a figure lunges forward, their hands clenched around my throat. Before I can react, they throw me into the wall, my body sliding down to the floor as I whimper in pain.

	“I don’t care who wants you alive,” Petri tells me, approaching, “I’m killing you for what you did.”

	[[My blade!]]
	[[My gun!]]
&lt;&lt;elseif $ls&gt;&gt;\
	Anger rushes through me as he snorts, diminishing my role here. Without thinking, I rush forward, punching him in the face and then dodging the punch he throws towards me.

	“No,” I hear Bradley whimper weakly.

	&lt;&lt;if $uncledead&gt;&gt;\
		“Trying to get revenge for that uncle of yours, hmm?” Raum asks me, as I land another punch. I grab my blade, about to swipe it across his face when he grabs my wrist. His grip tightens over my wrist, and I whimper as I involuntarily drop the blade, just wishing for him to let me go.

	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

	“You’re not strong enough to take me on, $name,” he chuckles, and with lightning, quick reflexes grabs my throat and sends me flying across the room.

	“No!” I hear Sydero scream, intercepting my body right before I hit what now seems to be a monstrous hole in the middle of the room. “Don’t touch the portal or you’ll die,” she tells me before disappearing from my side. I shudder, massaging my wrist as I get to my feet. Bradley! I need to get Bradley!

	I go back the way I came, killing a demon on the way as I make it back to the room, grabbing Bradley and bringing him after me. I drag us back to the main room, towards the door when another demon jumps me.

&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“Langston, Petri. Come handle Roe.” I whimper, turning to Bradley who&#39;s still not functioning anywhere near 10%.

	“Bradley, get out of the room, now,” I tell him, jumping at the sound of Langston’s voice behind me.

	“$name, you just can’t stay away, can you?” I turn around and take out my blade, looking between him and Petri. Both of them seem a bit worse for wear, and I can only think that they tangled with Sydero before being sent in here. I wasn’t going to win this fight, that was a fact. And dying here wasn’t in the cards either. I glance to the side of my vision to see Bradley weakly making his way towards the door.

	Before I can thoroughly think through my thoughts, I’m already turning around, grabbing Bradley, and throwing the door open. I surmise that a demon had closed us in. Otherwise, I don’t know what had kept me from leaving earlier. With Bradley hanging onto me, I rush down the hallway, only to be tripped and sending us both to the ground.

	Petri pounces on me, pinning both hands to the ground as he pushed his free hand into my heart. I shout, fighting to get free as I practically felt the tips of his wolfish nails on my heart, teasing it with light scrapes.

	“$name!” I hear Bradley scream though I can’t see him.

	“Leave the kid alone,” I whimper, knowing how foolish it was to care for his safety when I was about to meet death.

I look up to see a bright orange light originating from the central part of the house, the area I left Sydero. Before I can move, a figure flies into the wall, falling to the ground. A demon.

	I look back at Bradley, part of me thinking that I should just leave him here, but what would happen if something came in and retook him. No, it was dangerous, but I wanted him by my side. So, I grab him and make my way to the living room.

That’s when I see Langston’s dead body near the massive hole in the floor, his eyes still wide in shock and blood still oozing out of the cut in his throat.

“Enough!” Raum shouts, his voice dropping a few octaves and even managing to cause the building to tremble. His body sends out a shockwave that causes everyone affected to their knees. His eyes are an endless sea of black, no ounce of color within them. But my eyes are mostly drawn to who he has in his grip. Raum stands on the edge of the roaring portal, holding Bradley over it. My eyes move to Bradley, who’s frozen in place, his only movement comes from gripping tight to Raum’s arm.

“You are messing with forces who would squish you without a second thought,” he yells at us in outrage, “forces who don’t even deem you important.” Each word he says is filled with more anger, his body trembling.

My heart shifts ever so slightly, and Raum’s gaze lands on me next, a smile so crooked that I find myself quivering, yet unable to look away. It was as if he smelled my confusion, he probably did.

	“Hmm,” he hums, his body shaking due to his laughter, “I always thought as much, but never knew for sure.” He slowly moves his gaze to Sydero, who still struggles to stand. “You never told $him? Did you?”

	“Sydero, what is he talking about?” I find myself saying, though I don’t feel as if I said it. An out of body experience takes place as my soul looks around at those in the room. At Chris’s wide and terrified expression, at Sydero struggling yet avoiding my gaze, Raum’s relaxed stance, and Bradley whimpering as he literally is held over a pit of death.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“Who do you think you all are?” his gaze shoots to the boy in his grip, “all of you, and a simple human child, believing you can best me?” I wait for him to also look at me, but his gaze stays on Bradley. My heart shifts ever so slightly, and Raum’s gaze lands on me next, a smile so crooked that I find myself quivering, yet unable to look away. It was as if he smelled my confusion, he probably did.

	“Hmm,” he hums, his body shaking due to his laughter, “I always thought as much, but never knew for sure.” He slowly moves his gaze to Sydero, who still struggles to stand. “You never told $him? Did you?”

&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

“I would say I’m surprised, but I’m not,” Raum chuckles, lazily throwing me a smirk, “you’re not human, $name. Something I realized upon our first meeting, and something I know our dear Sydero has as well.” I feel ready to throw up, my head aching. It was horribly cold in here, despite my proximity to the fire raging.

“I didn’t tell you because I didn’t know what you were!” Sydero spat, narrowing her eyes on Raum as she refused to look me in the eye. “It would’ve been stupid to tell you but have no answers for you.”

[[“Stop making excuses!”]]

“I didn’t tell you because what was it going to solve,” she shouts back, “you know now, Roe, now what? You any closer to getting answers? No, you’re just going to be walking around confused even more now. Think I needed that –” She never finishes her sentence as she suddenly shoots forward, leaping across the portal and colliding into Raum’s form. The three of them go flying backward, demolishing the wall behind them as Bradley skids across the floor.

	I tell myself to go make sure Bradley’s okay, seeing that the boy hadn’t moved, and it doesn’t even look like he’s breathing. But I can’t move an inch, my feet stay planted to the ground, and my heart thumps wildly.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	“Bradley!” I shout, surging forward. Sliding across the ground as I touch the young boy. He shakes, looking at me with wide eyes. For a minute, I wonder if he’s looking at me differently because of what they had said, but as his tears well up and he pulls me into a tight hug, I suddenly doubt that.

“And yet, I made it. Now what, Roe?” she hisses, “you any closer to getting answers? No, you’re just going to be walking around confused even more now.

“Don’t say my name like that,” she growls harshly, refusing to look at me. When she does, her eyes are filled with rage, but it doesn’t take a blind person to see that that fury wasn’t directed at me. “I told you! I told you not to trust anyone, especially me! I warned you every step of the damn way. You did this to yourself … I hurt people, it’s all I’m good at,” she whispers, hanging her head in shame.

“Oh, such a moving –,” Raum begins to say, but he never gets a chance to finish his sentence as Sydero suddenly shoots forward, leaping across the portal and colliding into Raum’s form. The three of them go flying backward, demolishing the wall behind them as Bradley skids across the floor.

“I said I’m done playing games,” Raum shouts and just like that, he lets Bradley go. He screams as he falls towards the portal, his body thrashing to grab hold of something.

“No!” I hear Sydero shout and as if in slow motion, watch as she shoots over the portal, pushing Bradley roughly as her foot clips the portal. And that was all it took. Just one little touch and it pulled her in like a lassoed horse. She doesn’t scream, she doesn’t shout out curses if anything she almost appears to accept her fate. 

Her fingernails dig into the wooden floors as Raum chuckles, giving himself to the portal willingly. The sounds of the entrance swallowing the two rock the entire house, sounding like a tornado was encircling the house. The groans and moans that it had first made grow louder.

And then it’s all over. Just like that. The portal closes, leaving behind broken and charred wooden boards.

Raum is gone. Petri and any surviving demons are gone. The noise is gone.

Sydero is gone.

“What are you doing?”

“Giving her a choice,” she says, pointing at the gun, “one that you just snatched from the table.”

“Syd, this is not the way to go about it.”

“And yet here we are. Roe, don’t argue with me about this.”

I ignore her, turning my attention to the young woman, my heart bleeding for her, “there are better ways. Get help, talk to someone, fight for yourself. Okay? This,” I say and hold up the gun before throwing another look at Syd, “is not the answer.”

Thankfully Syd stands quietly, raising a brow at my words but saying nothing more.

“I need to think about what you guys said, but I’m glad that my ... path, led me here. I need to think about what I want, and ... just thank you.” Sydero nods and snatches the gun from me, pocketing it again. We see her out, watching as she takes her time to leave the way she came.
			
“You were just going to let her shoot her brains out at the kitchen table?” I question with a grimace and a raised brow.
			
“The gun wasn’t loaded,” she tells me, her eyes on the distant figure of the girl, “for your infomration, the point was to give her a choice. If she pulled the trigger, then she would’ve made her choice.”
			
“What if she was too scared to try a second time?”
			
“Then her choice would&#39;ve changed. If she really wanted out, she would find a way, regardless of an unloaded gun.”

“So, does this sort of thing happen a lot with you? You save or push people closer to that cliff?”
				
“Don’t word it like that,” Sydero growls, her attention still on the path the girl had taken, “but kinda. You meet a lot of people in this job, some because they become clients or you’re helping them. Others because they just stumble onto your path. You never know what will happen really. Tell me $name,” she turns to me, a rare serious expression on her face, “do you believe in fate?”
