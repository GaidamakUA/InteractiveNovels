out with four different boys already and I've only made out with one, 
but my thing was like I'm pretty sure those guys count as less than my 
boyfriend because I gave him a handy-J while his parents were out of 
town, and she was like well that doesn't *really* count because the 
lights were off and you couldn't see, but what I'm saying is he lives

have become situated in a forest. This is an inherent inefficiency of 
the hominid body form. All that remains for human beings to utilize,

 of paper back when we were kids. After high school I was going to go to
 Humber College to get a legit P.I. license and she was going to go to U
 of T to become a doctor. Then we'd rent a cool old house downtown and

MCBIRDFORD #3: *(still speaking at full volume)* If the Sheriff wants us
 to not surrender then surrender is the most logical course of action.

 that it is a deception.

MCBIRDFORD #3: Were that the case, following the Sheriff's commands 
would be the most disadvantageous course of action.

 the candlestick.

<tw-passagedata pid="235" name="olympics5" tags="" position="3650.0001,1400">DAN
 CANOE: First. That a species of lower cognitive function may be 
subjugated to a species of higher cognitive function for purposes 
including but not limited to consumption, transportation, service, and 
garment making.

LOGAN CRAFTS: Second. That younger humans are inferior in rank to older 
humans.

TJ SWIM: Third. That humans with superior strength and ability may 
legitimately exercise control over those with inferior strength and 
ability.

CASSIDY WOODS: Fourth. That legal authority is defined with regard to 
controlled land.

HEATHER ROPES: Fifth. That conquest is a valid form of land acquisition.

legitimate control over this area and therefore it has become ours. The

you've been reading my mind, you know it's true!

LOGAN CRAFTS: The human does speak the truth.

ALISHA SAIL: You have experienced this memory?

LOGAN CRAFTS: I have. It is as she says. Two groups participate in 
sporting events simultaneously, and the group with superior skill is the
 victor. Its narrative import in human mythology is frequently 
paramount.

HEATHER ROPES: A complication. I do not approve.

TJ SWIM: It is concordant with the third principle.

CASSIDY WOODS: According to the information I have gathered it seems to 
be an annual occurrence at this location.

DAN CANOE: We are the most skilled humans in the vicinity. Our victory 
in such a contest would be assured.

ALISHA SAIL: Very well, the human being named Bridget Leaside. We are 
obliged to act within the legal framework of this culture, and so we 
shall do. A Summer Camp Olympics will be conducted and control of this 
area will be transferred to the victor. The bird grouping will consist 
of the six counsellors that stand before you. The human grouping will 
consist of you. I hope for the sake of your species that you have been 
thoroughly training over the course of the summer.

*(Black feathers begin to rain down from the sky. Before you know it you
 are in a huge pile of feathers, first up to your ankles, then up to 
your knees, then your waist, then your chest, then your shoulders, then 
your chin. The feather rain is coming down faster and harder now. The 
feather level keeps raising, past your mouth, your nose, your eyes, and 
finally the top of your head. You are buried under an avalanche of 
feathers. There are feathers absolutely everywhere. Feathers on top of 
you, feathers beneath you, feathers inside of you, feathers all around 
you, feathers behind you, feathers in front of you, feathers all over 
you, feathers touching every inch of your body. You feel the accumulated
 weight pressing down on you from above. Your vision is totally blocked 
by feathers. You open your mouth to breathe and your lungs fill up with 
feathers. The feathers go down your throat. You feel sick from the lump 
of feathers in your stomach. You feel feathers coursing through your 
veins. Your whole body fills up with feathers. You can't feel your feet 
on the ground anymore. Your are in a void of feathers. There is no up or
 down or forward. There isn't even towards-the-feathers and 
away-from-the-feathers. The feathers are everywhere and every direction 
is feathers. You have absolutely no sense of direction or gravity. You 
have no sense of balance. No feeling of heat. The earth's magnetic field
 does not reach you. There is no chance of a single ray of sunlight 
hitting you. Feathers are all you can sense. You see nothing but 
feathers, hear nothing but feathers, taste nothing but feathers, smell 
nothing but feathers, touch nothing but feathers. You have no identity, 
no concept of self. You and the feathers are indistinguishable. There is
 one substance which makes up the universe, and that substance is 
feathers. The feathers erase all space and all time. There has never 
been anything here but feathers. There will never be anything but 
feathers. When the big bang burst it unleashed only an infinity of 
feathers, and when the universe dies its heat death there will only be 
ice cold feathers left to mark its place. The feathers themselves are 
made of more feathers. Your brain no longer exists. Your mind no longer 
exists. Your self no longer exists. The only thing which could ever 
exist is feathers. Your thoughts dissipate into the vast mass of 
feathers. You have long since lost the ability to speak, but nothing you
 could ever say would be anything but feathers. No nouns but feathers. 
No verbs but feathers. No adjectives or adverbs but feathers. You have 
never loved, or hated, or felt joy or sorrow. You can only feel 
feathers. The feathers are total. The feathers exist. The feathers are 
there. There are feathers. Just feathers. Feathers and feathers and

the medical stuff. You know, like whenever they have it on the shows

put me on the bus but I just refused to let go of her. And I had a super
 strong grip too, so that was no joke. Took two full-grown adults to pry
 me off her and stick me in a seat. But once the bus started moving I 
knew that there was no way out of it. So I said to myself, "Okay Zoe, 
you can't be scared anymore." I just decided to not be afraid. And you 
know what? Before we were even out of the city everything was all good. I
 was totally confident and camp turned out awesome.

And my heart... is like a different bird

If you... share that nest with that second bird&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="hide music12a2"&gt;♪ I saw your face the other day

You had a beak and everything  
It really made me want to sing&lt;/p&gt;

I just want your bird  
I just want your bird and I want it to fly&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="hide music12b2"&gt;Hear the sounds

They're the only birds that I want you to hear  
Biiiiiiiirds of love&lt;/p&gt;

And we... are two birds living inside that bird  
I... am not a bird  
Except... when I am a bird&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="hide music12c2"&gt;I saw your face today as well  
In fact I see it frequently  
I think that's 'cause you live nearby  
Your bird-face makes me want to fly&lt;/p&gt;

Some fly south and some stay here  
Depending on the weather and the time of year&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="hide music12e2"&gt;Sometimes birds they come together  
And sometimes birds they come apart  
The obvious rhyme here is with feather  
But is that rhyme what's in my heart?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="hide music12f1"&gt;I... am like a bird  
And you... are like a different bird  
We... could never be a bird  
We... will always be a pair of birds ♫&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="hide music12f2"&gt;I saw your face the other day  
And I'll see it again I'm sure

YOU: ...(Gonna) Dance A Lot. The "Gonna" is in brackets but I don't 
really know how you're supposed to pronounce that.

♪ I'm gonna dance  
I'm gonna dance a lot  
I'm going to a dance club  
I hear that's what people do

&lt;p class="hide music15a1"&gt;When I try to dance I'm totally drunk  
Or high on drugs or something like that  
The lights are purple and some guy from France  
Is standing by a laptop doing his thing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="hide music15a2"&gt;I'll dance with whoever  
The boys can't stop me now  
I'll smear lipstick on something  
At some point or another&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="hide music15a3"&gt;I just want to take you with me  
It would be so exciting just to dance together  
Believe me you won't want to sit this one out  
Or stay inside your cabin that night&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="hide music15a1 music15a2 music15a3"&gt;We're gonna dance  
We're gonna dance all night  
We're going to a dance club  
So that we can dance hard&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="hide music15b1"&gt;The music will get crazy  
And I will jump around  
In a totally cool way   
That won't be embarrassing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="hide music15b2"&gt;Everyone will watch me  
But I don't care  
Because no one that I know  
Will be there that night&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="hide music15b3"&gt;We've got cool shirts  
Our shirts are so cool  
Let's trade shirts  
Inside the club&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="hide music15b1 music15b2 music15b3"&gt;Let's all go dance  
Let's all go dance for fun  
And maybe let's forget  
That we didn't want to do it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="hide music15c1"&gt;Whoo! ♫&lt;/p&gt;

going to identify with it.

&lt;p class="hide music16a1"&gt;♪ I've got a secret that you've gotta 
hear  
I'm happier now than I've been all year  
My life is perfect, everything is fine  
This song's reflective of my state of mind&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="hide music16b1"&gt;It's really easy now to feel this way  
Just don't be sad at any time of day  
I'm totally honest this is how I feel

I am not hiding anything in shame  
Ask me again and I'll tell you the same&lt;/p&gt;

YOU: No idea. Why would you ask me?

LIZ: Because you two are like best buds now or whatever? You're sure you
 don't know?

YOU: ...Nope.

LIZ: No you don't know or no you're not sure?

*(The two of you step inside. Mackenzie, Bell, Zoe and the Taylors are 
all sitting around Taylor C's bed. You plop yourself down next to 
Bell.)*

TAYLOR M: ...All I said is I'm the reigning Euchre champ. Which is true.

TAYLOR C: Not even! I've won way more games than you. 

TAYLOR M: Yeah, but I won the last one. That means I'm reigning.

ZOE: *(shuffling cards)* You're both champs in my book. Now do either of
 you know how we're supposed to do this with seven players? 

YOU: Don't worry, I don't know how to play. I'm just going to look over 
Bell's shoulder.

BELL: Cheating.

YOU: &lt;% if (s.lastnight46) { %&gt; You would know! *(You push her.)* 
Besides, it's not cheating if I'm not playing. &lt;% } else { %&gt; It's

BELL: *(grinning)* Semantics.

LIZ: Okay good. If we're allowed to be out then I'm out too. 

*(She rubs her face with her hands.)*

ZOE: Damn dude you look *rough*.

LIZ: Same old. Electronics withdrawal taking its toll.

MACKENZIE: You should try Bridget's walking thing. It might help you 
relax.

LIZ: Walking thing? *(She looks over at you.)*

YOU: Uh...

MACKENZIE: You know, the midnight walks?

TAYLOR C: Oh yeah, you've been going out every night lately, huh?

YOU: I mean–

TAYLOR M: Just wandering around camp by yourself you said, right?

TAYLOR C: Does seem to help you blow off steam.

*(Bell smirks just a little bit. Liz's eyes widen and her mouth hangs 
open.)*

YOU: Uh yeah they're great. Very peaceful. Recommended. *(You get up 
from the bed.)* On a totally unrelated note I've got to go outside for

YOU: Yes.

YOU: But you can't tell *anybody*, okay? It's a secret!

LIZ: Are you sure?? Because my instinct right now is to tell like ten 
thousand people.

*(You grab her shoulders.)*

YOU: Liz, do not go all Taylor M on me right now. You have to keep this 
quiet. For real. No one else knows. 

LIZ: Okay... okay. But can we at least talk about it a little?

YOU: Fine. Yes. *(You glance around again.)* A little. What do you want 
to know?

LIZ: I don't know, like, when did it start and where was your first kiss
 and who kissed who first and did you tell each other you liked each 
other before the kiss or after and how did you know you liked her and 
how long have you known you liked girls and how long has she known and 
do people back home know and is she the first girl you've ever been with
 and are you in love with her and are you officially calling yourselves 
girlfriends and do you hold hands all the time when we aren't watching 
and what's your favourite thing about her and do you make out all the 
time and is it awesome?

YOU: Okay! Okay! Steady. Come by with Bell tonight and we'll tell you 
everything. 

*(She applauds and then pulls you into a hug.)*

 this as one of the best summers of your life. You only get to be 14

 was panicking for sure. No question. He had his big conference and he 
wanted it to go off without a hitch. Certainly didn't want the cops 
showing up and scaring off all the Silicon Valley assholes. So he had to
 go to someone outside the system. And it just so happened I was 
downstairs.

up and starts walking around.)* Like okay let's say for a second that 
the pre-teen detective you've hired somehow manages to solve this murder
 case. *Then* what happens? You still have a dead body on the floor. You
 still have to call the police. And they're not going to just wait for 
the keynote address to be over or whatever. They're going to come in and
 bust up all your shit. AND it's not like the actual cops are going to 
be like "Oh cool thanks for solving this murder we'll just take your 
word for it that you found the right guy". They have to double-check 
*everything* they didn't do themselves. Trust me, I know. They won't 
even let you friggin' find a lost cat without giving a written statement
 first.

*(She starts walking faster)*

BELL: But EVEN IF all this would somehow work. Even if! What does he 
think's going to happen later? Does he really think his reputation will 
be saved just because the police didn't bust down the door in the middle
 of his dumb thing? Like people will really care that the dead body was 
found *after* the social media panel? And Christ, obviously the 
coroner's going to be able to tell time of death. That'll get out there 
no question. People will know he waited to call in the crime. The *cops*
 will know – which by the way is exactly what happened with that other 
guy. The one who found the body right away but didn't say anything. Dude
 got in *such shit* and that was just him waiting like forty minutes.

 Allow me to reinforce this process with several factual statements: The

you in every relevant field. You are inferior in courage. You are 
inferior in intelligence. You are inferior in physical strength. You are
 inferior in vehicular operation.

disembark the vehicle. The individual who completes this task in the 
least amount of time will be designated the winner. But you have no 
qualities or abilities which would allow you to disembark at a greater 
speed than the human designated Alisha Sail. In addition, when this 
vehicle arrives at the dock I will manoeuvre it in such a way that I 
will be the nearest to the dock and you will be the furthest from it, 
thus amplifying your disadvantage. The only likely possibility that 
arises from these facts is the one stating that you will fail to achieve
 victory. You and your companion will be neutralized.
